    "text": "Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) What is Applied Behavior Analysis  Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) is a therapy based on the science of learning and behavior. Behavior analysis helps us to understand  How behavior works How behavior is affected by the environment How learning takes place ABA therapy applies our understanding of how behavior works to real situations. The goal is to increase behaviors that are helpful and decrease behaviors that are harmful or affect learning. ABA therapy programs can help  Increase language and communication skills Improve attention, focus, social skills, memory, and academics Decrease problem behaviors The methods of behavior analysis have been used and studied for decades. They have helped many kinds of learners gain different skills   from healthier lifestyles to learning a new language. Therapists have used ABA to help children with autism and related developmental disorders since the 1960s. How does ABA therapy work  Applied Behavior Analysis involves many techniques for understanding and changing behavior. ABA is a flexible treatment  Can be adapted to meet the needs of each unique person Provided in many different locations   at home, at school, and in the community Teaches skills that are useful in everyday life Can involve one-to-one teaching or group instruction Positive reinforcement Positive reinforcement is one of the main strategies used in ABA. When a behavior is followed by something that is valued (a reward), a person is more likely to repeat that behavior. Over time, this encourages positive behavior change. First, the therapist identifies a goal behavior. Each time the person uses the behavior or skill successfully, they get a reward. The reward is meaningful to the individual   examples include praise, a toy or book, watching a video, access to playground or other location, and more. Positive rewards encourage the person to continue using the skill. Over time this leads to meaningful behavior change. Antecedent, behavior, consequence Understanding antecedents (what happens before a behavior occurs) and consequences (what happens after the behavior) is another important part of any ABA program. The following three steps   the  A-B-Cs    help us teach and understand behavior  An antecedent  this is what occurs right before the target behavior. It can be verbal, such as a command or request. It can also be physical, such a toy or object, or a light, sound, or something else in the environment. An antecedent may come from the environment, from another person, or be internal (such as a thought or feeling). A resulting behavior  this is the person s response or lack of response to the antecedent. It can be an action, a verbal response, or something else. A consequence  this is what comes directly after the behavior. It can include positive reinforcement of the desired behavior, or no reaction for incorrect inappropriate responses. Looking at A-B-Cs helps us understand  Why a behavior may be happening How different consequences could affect whether the behavior is likely to happen again Example  Antecedent  The teacher says  It s time to clean up your toys  at the end of the day. Behavior  The student yells  no   Consequence  The teacher removes the toys and says  Okay, toys are all done. How could ABA help the student learn a more appropriate behavior in this situation  Antecedent  The teacher says  time to clean up  at the end of the day. Behavior  The student is reminded to ask,  Can I have 5 more minutes   Consequence  The teacher says,  Of course you can have 5 more minutes   With continued practice, the student will be able to replace the inappropriate behavior with one that is more helpful. This is an easier way for the student to satisfy the child s needs  What does an ABA program involve  Good ABA programs for autism are not  one size fits all. ABA should not be viewed as a canned set of drills. Rather, each program is written to meet the needs of the individual learner. The goal of any ABA program is to help each person work on skills that will help them become more independent and successful in the short term as well as in the future. Planning and ongoing assessment A qualified and trained behavior analyst (BCBA) designs and directly oversees the program. They customize the ABA program to each learner s skills, needs, interests, preferences and family situation. The BCBA will start by doing a detailed assessment of each person s skills and preferences. They will use this to write specific treatment goals. Family goals and preferences may be included, too. Treatment goals are written based on the age and ability level of the person with ASD. Treatment goals can include many different skill areas, such as  Communication and language Social skills Self-care (such as showering and toileting) Play and leisure Motor skills Learning and academic skills The instruction plan breaks down each of these skills into small, concrete steps.",

    "text": "The therapist teaches each step one by one, from simple (e.g. imitating single sounds) to more complex (e.g. carrying on a conversation). The BCBA and therapists measure progress by collecting data in each therapy session. Data helps them to monitor the person s progress toward goals on an ongoing basis. The behavior analyst regularly meets with family members and program staff to review information about progress. They can then plan ahead and adjust teaching plans and goals as needed. ABA techniques and philosophy The instructor uses a variety of ABA procedures. Some are directed by the instructor and others are directed by the person with autism. Parents, family members and caregivers receive training so they can support learning and skill practice throughout the day. The person with autism will have many opportunities to learn and practice skills each day. This can happen in both planned and naturally occurring situations. For instance, someone learning to greet others by saying  hello  may get the chance to practice this skill in the classroom with their teacher (planned) and on the playground at recess (naturally occurring). The learner receives an abundance of positive reinforcement for demonstrating useful skills and socially appropriate behaviors. The emphasis is on positive social interactions and enjoyable learning. The learner receives no reinforcement for behaviors that pose harm or prevent learning. ABA is effective for people of all ages. It can be used from early childhood through adulthood  Who provides ABA services  A board-certified behavior analyst (BCBA) provides ABA therapy services. To become a BCBA, the following is needed  Earn a master s degree or PhD in psychology or behavior analysis Pass a national certification exam Seek a state license to practice (in some states) ABA therapy programs also involve therapists, or registered behavior technicians (RBTs). These therapists are trained and supervised by the BCBA. They work directly with children and adults with autism to practice skills and work toward the individual goals written by the BCBA. You may hear them referred to by a few different names  behavioral therapists, line therapists, behavior tech, etc. To learn more, see the Behavior Analyst Certification Board website. What is the evidence that ABA works  ABA is considered an evidence-based best practice treatment by the US Surgeon General and by the American Psychological Association. Evidence based  means that ABA has passed scientific tests of its usefulness, quality, and effectiveness. ABA therapy includes many different techniques. All of these techniques focus on antecedents (what happens before a behavior occurs) and on consequences (what happens after the behavior). More than 20 studies have established that intensive and long-term therapy using ABA principles improves outcomes for many but not all children with autism. Intensive  and  long term  refer to programs that provide 25 to 40 hours a week of therapy for 1 to 3 years. These studies show gains in intellectual functioning, language development, daily living skills and social functioning. Studies with adults using ABA principles, though fewer in number, show similar benefits. Is ABA covered by insurance  Sometimes. Many types of private health insurance are required to cover ABA services. This depends on what kind of insurance you have, and what state you live in. All Medicaid plans must cover treatments that are medically necessary for children under the age of 21. If a doctor prescribes ABA and says it is medically necessary for your child, Medicaid must cover the cost. Please see our insurance resources for more information about insurance and coverage for autism services. You can also contact the Autism Response Team if you have difficulty obtaining coverage, or need additional help. Where do I find ABA services  To get started, follow these steps  Speak with your pediatrician or other medical provider about ABA. They can discuss whether ABA is right for your child. They can write a prescription for ABA if it is necessary for your insurance. Check whether your insurance company covers the cost of ABA therapy, and what your benefit is. Search our Resource Guide for ABA providers near you. Or, ask your child s doctor and teachers for recommendations. Call the ABA provider and request an intake evaluation. Have some questions ready (see below ) What questions should I ask  It s important to find an ABA provider and therapists who are a good fit for your family. The first step is for therapists to establish a good relationship with your child. If your child trusts his therapists and enjoys spending time with them, therapy will be more successful   and fun  The following questions can help you evaluate whether a provider will be a good fit for your family.",

We have partnered with parents to teach their children and learned from the challenges and joys they experienced while raising a child with autism. Many of these parents consistently requested a written overview that de ned and described methods used within Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) programming. Parents wanted this information during their initial search to better understand this treatment approach, and during their journey to increase their knowledge and abilities. Unfortunately, only a few such publications have met this need and they cover slightly different topics. This book is intended for those parents and professionals who want an overview of Applied Behavior Analysis and the meaningful changes it can make in the lives of people with autism. The book is divided into brief segments that focus on speci c topics. Within each section, readers can expect a description or de nition of the topic, examples from everyday settings, and references for further information. References are largely drawn from the professional literature with an emphasis on those that have a high degree of scienti c validity. We hope this book is helpful to you and we welcome your feedback for future revisions. It is important to emphasize that this book is an overview and the resources listed in each section and at the end should be referred to for a more comprehensive understanding of the discussed topics.

So the question is  why ABA  There are many anecdotes that appear to support numerous treatments. ABA stands out because its foundation is the collection and review of direct observational data. There have been hundreds of well-controlled studies published in the professional literature documenting ABA s effectiveness with learners with autism (Matson et al., 1996). Most of these studies have focused on one or two speci c behaviors that required intensive teaching or treatment. Some have focused on the learners  behavior as well as the therapists  and the parents  behavior during academic and social interactions. Approximately ten studies have explored the long-term effects of intensive ABA programming for young children with autism. The results of these studies challenged previous notions that people with autism could not be educated or that they could not lead meaningful and independent lives.

Some of these children learned so much that today it is hard to tell them apart from typically developing children.",

    "text": "While there is still much to learn about how early behavioral intervention affects young children with autism, there are some powerful messages from the studies conducted so far (Green, 1996). Several state and federal agencies have heard these powerful messages and agree that there is solid evidence that early and intensive ABA intervention can produce comprehensive and meaningful improvements for a large proportion of children with autism (for example, Maine Administrators of Services for Children with Disabilities (MADSEC) Autism Taskforce, 1999  New York State Department of Health, 1999  U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, 1999). Additionally, the United States Congress commissioned a panel of autism experts to publish a state of the research on autism and provide recommendations for public policy and future research (National Research Council, 2001). While they recognized the contribution of a behavior-based approach in autism treatment, they pointed out the lack of comparison studies of among this and other popular treatments. The results from this type of study would shed more de nitive light on the question of which treatment was the best. They stressed the importance of conducting studies that directly compared interventions so that educators and parents could select the most effective treatment for an individual with autism. Since then, two comparison studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals. While there are limits to how much information can be gleaned from only two studies (described below), the results tells us more about the effectiveness of ABA. How does ABA compare to other treatments  Howard, Sparkman, Cohen, Green,   Stainslaw (2005) published a study on the effects of three different treatment approaches used within early intervention. Sixty-one young children with autism spectrum disorders received one of three treatment procedures  a) intensive behavior analytic intervention, b) intensive eclectic intervention which was a combination of popular methods, or c) non-intensive public early intervention. The children were an average of 34 months old when they entered the study. The study measured each child s skills before and after a 14-month intervention in the areas of  a) cognitive, b) non-verbal, c) receptive expressive language, and d) adaptive skills. The results of this study showed that children in an intensive ABA program produced signi cant improvement across all four areas compared to the children who received eclectic and non-intensive treatments. The study even found that the children who received non-intensive early intervention showed a regression. What about children with autism who enter treatment at a later age  There is some evidence that these children also bene t substantially from ABA instruction when compared to children who participated in other interventions of similar intensity (Eikeseth, Smith, Jahr,   Eldevik, 2002). The researchers examined the progress of 25 4-7 year olds who received either intensive behavioral treatment or intensive eclectic treatment in public school settings. The results indicated that children who participated in intensive behavioral treatment made large improvements across all measured skill areas (i.e., cognitive, visual- spatial, language, and adaptive behavior skills) as compared to those children who received intensive eclectic treatment. The same is likely to be true for adults with autism. While there are well-documented effects of behavioral assessment and intervention strategies on improved functioning for adults with autism (McClannahan, MacDuff,   Krantz, 2002), there are limited long-term data on intensive programs for adults. However, it is clear that many adults experience real and substantial gains come from ABA intervention. Thus, it stands to reason that ABA remains a central and effective component of services for individuals of all ages with autism. Early and intensive ABA programming is cost effective and potentially life changing for individuals and their families (Jacobson, Mulick,   Green, 1998). Why not turn to science and get the best available treatment  When you review the results of the research, you will  nd ABA. Introduction 4Celiberti, D. A., Buchanan, S. M., Bleeker, F.

Introduction 5ABA makes meaningful changes in people s lives through the use of procedures that have been demonstrated to work. The following description of ABA was adapted from Green (1996). Behavior analytic treatment for autism uses reinforcement in structured and natural environments to help individuals learn new skills. Skills ranging from simple to complex are broken down into small, measurable units and systematically taught. A high-priority goal is making it enjoyable for the learner. Through carefully planned guidance and reinforcement, the learner is more likely to exhibit appropriate behavior during and after the teaching interaction. In contrast, problem behaviors are not reinforced. Some analysis may be necessary to determine the function(s) and reinforcers for these behaviors to develop an effective intervention plan.What is ABA  On a more technical note, Cooper, Heron, and Heward (1987) de ne ABA as  the science in which procedures derived from the principles of behavior are systematically applied to improve socially signi cant behavior to a meaningful degree and to demonstrate experimentally that the procedures employed were responsible for the improvement in behavior. (p. 14) As we said above, ABA makes meaningful changes in people s lives through the use of procedures that have been demonstrated to work. During the last  fty years, Behavior Analysis has been referred to in a number of different terms, including behavior modi cation, behavior management, contingency management, positive approaches, and operant or Skinnerian 7psychology. Most of these terms fail to fully capture the nature and dimensions of contemporary behavior analysis, and bring with them associations that are either inaccurate or misleading. Here is some accurate information. Behavior Analysis has two main branches  experimental and applied. The experimental analysis of behavior is a  eld of study in which animals and humans participate in experiments and researchers observe how they behave and learn in different situations. The results of these studies are then used to inform Applied Behavior Analysis, ABA, which is the service part of the discipline. In other words, this type of behavior analyst works with people to improve their behavior and quality of life. ABA programs are based on empirical research, include the direct observation and measurement of behavior, and utilize antecedent stimuli, positive reinforcement, and other consequences to produce behavior change. ABA is a well-developed discipline among the human service professions. It has a mature body of knowledge, established standards for practice, distinct methods of service, recognized experience and educational requirements for practice, and identi ed sources of requisite education in universities.

What is ABA  8The behavioral teaching approach takes into account a few factors, such as the student s current level of performance, the skill acquisition and behavior reduction goals, and some assumptions about what causes behavior (performance) to occur. ABA views the immediate present as the key to comprehending current behavior, and uses information about the past cautiously (for example, to understand how a behavioral pattern developed over time). Causes of Behavior 1. Genetic explanations - With the human genome project complete, we now know more about how genes affect behavior. Unfortunately, this information is not yet helpful in producing a medical treatment or cure for autism. 2. Past experiences (sometimes called reinforcement history or learning history)   Behavior analysts study how behaviors are acquired and maintained through reinforcement. While it is important to understand a person s How Behavior Analysts Approach Teaching history of experiences, this source may yield only limited and insuf cient information about how to increase a person s behavioral skills. 3. Immediate environment   the events that are happening during every moment of our lives. This includes the setting, other people present and their behavior, objects, activities, routines, resources, etc. Behavior analysts see the immediate environment as the major cause of behavior. They collect very speci c information about what happens before and after a behavior. They then use this information to make appropriate behavior more likely and inappropriate behavior less likely. Parents and teachers can have a tremendous impact on behavior because they are such a large part of the child s immediate environment. So, the more you know about maximizing learning, the more you can change a person s behavior. 9Let s look more closely at how behavior analysts study the interaction between the immediate environment and behavior. One of the main things that behavior analysts do is examine the ABCs  Antecedents, Behavior, and Consequences. Antecedent  what comes before a speci c behavior Behavior  the behavior itself Consequence  what happens after a speci c behavior This analysis helps to pinpoint what may trigger a behavior and assists in identifying what consequences keep a behavior going. Example  Teaching Exchange Teacher says,  Get your lunchbox. It s time to eat. (Antecedent) Student walks to cubby, gets lunchbox, walks to seat at table, and sits down. (Behavior) Teacher says,  Terri c work, Johnny. You got your lunchbox. You re ready to eat. (Consequence) A B C 10Both the antecedent (the instruction) and the consequence (eating lunch) in uence whether the behavior will happen again. Example  Challenging Behavior Teacher says,  Let s clean up. It is time for circle. (Antecedent) Student throws blocks, lies on  oor, and screams. (Behavior) Teacher says,  We need to clean up our toys,  and helps child to put blocks in the box. (Consequence) Both the antecedent (the instruction) and the consequence (not allowed to continue playing) in uence whether the behavior will happen again. In real situations, other factors such as the learner s motivation and setting events are taken into account. These simple examples are presented for illustration purposes of the ABC analysis. What does this mean for me  We can understand how and when behaviors occur by examining antecedents and consequences. We often can change behaviors by changing what we do immediately before and immediately after behavior. ABCs of BehaviorWhat Principles and Methods Comprise ABA  Motivation is the heart and soul of ABA. Behavior analysts want to know what a person is motivated by, what interests her, and what she experiences as fun. The old clich  is true  different strokes for different folks. Perhaps you enjoy a good meal of Italian food while another person prefers a backyard barbeque. The same is true for learners with autism.",

    "text": "Motivation is individually determined and best understood by observing the person and his her choices. It also is important to keep in mind that motivation can change on a moment-to-moment basis. Even though you like a good barbeque, you probably wouldn t want one every night of the week. Here s another example  sometimes you prefer to listen to calm music and other times to loud, upbeat music. To maximize the learner s fun and performance, behavior analysts encourage him her to make choices and incorporate these preferences into the teaching interaction. This moment-to-moment analysis of the learner s motivation can seem like a lot of hard work, which goes above and beyond the standard curriculum and typical teaching strategies. So, why is this important and worthwhile  When equipped with this information, behavior analysts can offer fun activities, interesting objects, and desirable items to the learner. The learner then associates the instructor with those fun and desirable items and activities. This often is called pairing yourself with reinforcement. It is the essence of making learning fun and of building a positive association with the instructor. The instructor becomes the source of fun and desirable items, the person who gives squishy balls, teddy grahams, hugs, high  ves, trips to the playground, and giggles. Motivation also is about understanding why Motivation a learner engages in a certain behavior, and is very relevant to understanding challenging behaviors. When we understand what a person is motivated to obtain (attention, a desired object, a break from instructional demands), we can reorganize the environment. We can provide motivating things in the absence of challenging behavior and teach the learner ways to appropriately request them. Technically speaking, motivation is often called an  establishing operations  (EO) or a  motivational operation  (MO). They are events with to properties  1. a reinforcer-establishing effect that establishes what is reinforcing in the moment 2. an evocative effect that evokes a particular response In simple terms, an EO determines what is wanted and in uences what the individual does to get the desired item. Here s an example with an adolescent with autism. Jason has been outside on a hot day. He gets thirsty and desires water (the reinforcer-establishing effect). We now have established water as a potential reinforcer. The second property, called an evocative effect, is demonstrated when Jason does something to obtain that reinforcer (water). He might take his teacher s hand and lead her to the water fountain. He also might give her a picture of a glass of water. Thus, the same reinforcer could evoke different response at different times or for different people. Responses that have been successful in the past are more likely to occur than other responses. ABA Principles   Methods 12Here s another example. A child sees a popular toy from a favorite movie in the toy store. She may want it. This is the reinforcer-establishing effect. Once in the toy store, she may request the toy because such requests have been honored in the past. This is the evocative effect. If requests have led to obtaining desired things, the likelihood of requesting is high in these situations. This is true for both appropriate and inappropriate behaviors used to request desired items. Therefore, this concept also can be used to understand how challenging behaviors emerge. ABA instructors are very interested in EOs, and in maximizing motivation in general. Understanding EOs signi cantly increases the success of instruction. A student is new to the learning environment. The teacher puts out an array of enticing toys and foods. She samples some and plays with some, and waits for the learner to indicate an interest. As the learner reaches for an item, she immediately grants access to the item. She also offers praise, hugs and attention while the learner eats the snacks and plays with the toys. She is pairing herself with rewards and working to identify EOs. She wants to know what the learner wants. Eventually, she will ask the learner to engage in a brief task before granting access to the desired item.Delmolino, L.,   Harris, S. L. (2004).

    "text": "We may not call it reinforcement, but it is happening all the time  Reinforcement Reinforcement involves 1) the systematic and immediate delivery of a consequence (following a behavior) and 2) an increased likelihood that the behavior will happen again. In fact, we can only know that something is a reinforcer after we watch its effect on behavior over time. Simply providing a preferred item contingent upon a behavior will not necessarily result in an increase in behavior under similar conditions in the future. Type 1 reinforcement (also referred to as positive reinforcement) involves the addition of something desirable, such as praise, hugs, a gummy bear, and stickers. Example 1 A teacher is instructing Thomas to point to objects. She puts a ball, a cup, a shoe, a spoon, and a hat on the table. She instructs him to  Touch the shoe. Thomas touches the shoe. The teacher enthusiastically says,  Hooray  You touched the shoe. Now you get to put on your shoes and go outside. t Behavior  following an instruction by touching an item t Consequence  received praise and a chance to go outside and play t Future effect  makes following instructions more likely to occur the next time someone asks him to do something Example 2 Johnny sees a friend eating a cookie. He points to the cookie. His mother then gives him a cookie. t Behavior  pointing to a desired item (cookie) to ask for it t Consequence  received a cookie when (and only when) he asked for it t Future effect  makes pointing to a desired item (cookie) more likely to occur the next time he sees something he wantsType 1 Reinforcement ABA Principles   Methods 14Type 2 reinforcement (also referred to as negative reinforcement) involves the removal of something undesirable. Example 1 We turn off an alarm clock to stop the loud repetitive sound. t Behavior  touching  off  button on clock t Consequence  removing undesirable alarm sound t Future effect  makes  touching- off-button  behavior more likely to occur the next time alarm sounds Example 2 At McDonald s Playland, a child is overwhelmed by the loud noises. The child requests to leave, saying  car, car. The family leaves. t Behavior  requesting to go home t Consequence  exiting reduces exposure to undesired noise t Future effect  makes requesting to go home more likely to occur the next time child experiences high noise level Type 2 Reinforcementt generalized reinforcers such as tokens and money that allow access to a range of other primary and secondary reinforcers. Effective programming makes use of both types of reinforcement to maximize the learner s progress. The behavior analyst s goal is to move toward the type and schedule of reinforcement that will maintain the behavior in typical settings. Both positive and negative reinforcement increase behavior by making the learner s life better. A note on negative reinforcement  The common de nition and the ABA de nition of negative reinforcement are different. As previously mentioned, the ABA de nition refers to an increase in behavior when something annoying is stopped or prevented because of our behavior. In contrast, the common use of the term is a synonym for punishment. These terms can lead to confusion. The important piece to focus on is the learner s behavior and what happens following the behavior. If the learner repeatedly behaves in ways that result in escape or avoidance of something undesirable, negative reinforcement is in effect. Readers are referred to text books on ABA for further information and clari cation. It can be tempting to think of preferred items as reinforcers. Yet, before doing so, it must be demonstrated that the contingent use of the preferred item is the reason for a behavior increase  only then can the item be called a reinforcer. For learners with autism, some items and activities are more likely to be reinforcers than others. Primary reinforcers serve a biological function and include food, water, warmth, and sexual stimulation. Initially, learners with autism may be more responsive to primary reinforcers. Secondary reinforcers gain their potency because they were paired with primary reinforcers or other established secondary reinforcers. There are four types of secondary reinforcers  t tangible reinforcers such as trinkets and toys, t activities-oriented reinforcers such as playing a game and going to the movies, t social reinforcers such as physical contact and verbal praise, and ABA Principles   Methods 15Reinforcement Cooper, J.

    "text": "Paci c Grove, CA  Brooks Cole Publishing Company.ResourcesShaping Shaping is a way to reinforce improvement in behavior. Shaping is used to gradually teach the learner how to do something better. Over time, an instructor rewards attempts that look more like the desired behavior. Thus, the learner is encouraged through reinforcement to exhibit more appropriate behavior. While shaping behavior can be a slow process, it can be quite effective if done correctly. This process requires that the teacher has both intimate knowledge of the learner and the ability to shift gears based on the learner s performance. One of the positive effects of shaping includes decreasing frustration by providing feedback to the learner that he  she is on the right track. Learning becomes more rewarding because there are many opportunities for reinforcement along the way. When shaping behavior, there are several things to remember. First, shaping is both an art and a science. The teacher has to respond to the learner s performance. On a moment-to-moment basis, she must match the amount of the learner s effort with the amount of reinforcement. On a broader scale, a teacher must set her requirements based on the learner s performance throughout the day. For example, if a child is feeling ill, it is a good idea to maintain the program and not require additional effort on this particular day. Second, the learner will become skilled more quickly when all of his her teachers communicate and agree. This is to say that consistency across teachers, parents, and others is an important component of the shaping process. All instructors must communicate to understand the current teaching plan. When everyone implements the same protocol, the learner more ef ciently acquires skills. This emphasis on consistency is also valuable for all other teaching programs. Behavior analysts often describe their teaching method as  shaping  a particular behavior. For example, they may say that they are shaping vocal sounds. At  rst, a vocal approximation of a word would be reinforced, for example  ba  for  ball. As the child becomes more  uent in making sounds, the teacher reinforces only vocal approximations that sound like the target word. Behavior analysts also shape other behavior, such as compliance, by asking a learner to follow one easy instruction. When the learner performs that skill well, the teacher expects more. To follow the above examples, she may ask the child to say,  want ball,  or to follow two instructions. ABA Principles   Methods 16Resource Foxx, R. M. (1982). Increasing behaviors of persons with severe retardation and autism. Champaign, IL  Research Press .Prompts Prompts are de ned as extra cues or hints that help the learner to know what to do in a particular situation or time. Prompts are things we do to increase the likelihood that learners will make the correct responses. Whenever a learner is being taught something for the  rst time or has not yet mastered a skill independently, prompting should be used to ensure correct responses and to prevent errors. Even after a learner has mastered a skill, he she may still need prompting to respond within an appropriate amount of time and in new situations. MacDuff, G. S., Krantz, P. J.,   McClannahan, L. E.

Austin, TX  PRO-ED. Van Houten, R. (1998). How to use prompts to initiate behavior. Austin, TX  PRO-ED.Generally, we use more obvious prompts when teaching a new skill and more subtle prompts when the learner has mastered a skill but needs a reminder. Types of prompts include  t physical or hand-over-hand assistance t gestural such as pointing t modeling or demonstration t visual such as a picture t textual such as written checklist t verbal such as  What do you want   Example 1 The instructor says,  Do this,  while clapping her hands together. She then reaches over to take the child s hands and makes a clapping motion with them. This physical prompt ensures that the learner correctly imitates the teacher. Example 2 A mother and a child are in a toy store. The mother says,  You can pick out a toy. The child does not respond. The mother then shows him two toys and verbally prompts him,  Do you want Winnie the Pooh or Elmo   The child grabs Elmo. The mother notices that the visual and verbal prompts made his response more likely.

    "text": "These things are much easier to do if you have watched someone do it.) Typically developing children watch and imitate others all day long. A model is any antecedent (before the behavior) stimulus that is identical in form to the behavior. A model is a stimulus that the learner imitates. If we want the child to clap his her hands, and we clap our hands while saying,  Do this,  we have provided a model. As mentioned in the previous section, a model is a type of prompt. Models are used in imitation training to help learners copy our behavior. Modeling is a powerful instructional tool that also can assist learners to master complex skills. For example, modeling can be used to teach appropriate behavior in social situations. A teacher might instruct a learner to  Do what your friends are doing,  when he she looks lost during a transitional time while other students are cleaning up materials. Peers are a wonderful source of learning by modeling. Peers in a classroom can model appropriate ways to pay attention, complete an assignment, ask for help, and interact in all kinds of ways. Usually, we think of modeling as the imitation of people who are physically present. However, modeling also can be taught using videotapes. Video modeling has been shown to be a highly effective technique for teaching play skills and some social skills. A learner might watch videotaped sequences of children playing imaginatively with a dollhouse, and then practice what was viewed. Because of the central importance of learning by observation, imitation training often is a major focus of early instruction. Learners need to be able to imitate very simple tasks, sequences of actions, and novel actions. When a learner has demonstrated the ability to widely imitate and to imitate novel actions, they often are said to have achieved generalized imitation (see page 45). This is an important goal for all learners. A child with this ability will be able to learn from classmates and other peers. Many ABA programs spend a lot of time during the initial phase of instruction teaching learners how to imitate. Later phases of instruction incorporate a variety of experiences to help the learner imitate in more real life situations. Another consideration is that learners with autism may not be initially motivated to learn these skills. Instructors should pay careful attention to the quality, quantity, and variety of reinforcement provided for progress. Much of children s learning develops through imitation as they repeat what they hear and do what they see. Imitation is a valuable developmental achievement. The ability to consistently and  uently imitate others offers many bene ts in all aspects of life. ABA Principles   Methods 18ABA Principles   Methods 19Buggey, T. (2009).

How to teach through modeling and imitation (2nd ed.). Austin, TX  PRO-ED.ResourcesModeling (Imitation Training)Discrete trial instruction (DTI) or discrete trial teaching (DTT) has historically been the primary instructional method used in ABA intervention for children with autism. It is a very systematic and methodical way of teaching and is supported by a history of success in teaching skills across all areas. This technique is well suited to individuals with autism because it makes instruction very clear to the learner. Discrete trials are comprised of several components. 1. an SD, or a discriminative stimulus (an instruction) 2. a response (what the child does in response to the instruction) 3. a consequence (feedback to the child about his her response) There has been some research on the most effective ways to teach when using discrete trials. Here is a summary of several of those issues. 1. Teach in an errorless way. We know that children with autism have a tendency to repeat errors, so it is important to prevent errors and to interrupt errors whenever possible. (It is rare that anyone could learn a skill without any Discrete Trial Instruction Discrete Trial Teaching MYTH DTI is just doing the same thing over and over and over again. FACT Historically, people did do DTI as blocks of trials, typically working on the same target behavior repetitively. Children were asked to do the same thing many times errors. The point here is to minimize the errors that a learner may make.) 2. Mix in new material with older, known material. Technically, this is called task interspersal.",

    "text": "For interspersal to be effective, you must mix in a new item with items that learners know very well (have already mastered). We know that learners learn more rapidly when taught in this way. It also is more naturalistic than asking a child to do the same thing many times in a row. 3. Collect data on learning progress. This may be done on a trial-by-trial basis, or through probe data collection techniques (in which the teacher takes data only on some of the trials). Discrete Trial Instruction is sometimes described incompletely or inaccurately. This is because DTI has been conducted for many years, and the de nition of  best practice  DTI has changed along with the evolution of the  eld of ABA. Therefore, some people s views of DTI are only partly accurate because they do not have the most up-to-date information. Here are some of the most common misconceptions that people may have about DTI. (most often 10 times) in a row. While we know that repetition helps learning and that children with autism require many trials of instruction to learn new things, we also know that learning is more ef cient if we vary what we ask the child to do. Best practice now dictates that we slowly intersperse new items with things the child knows very well. ABA Principles   Methods 20Discrete Trial Instruction Discrete Trial Teaching MYTH DTI is very slow paced. FACT Historically, DTI was slower in pace than other types of instruction. This is because it was usually done with trial-by-trial data recording, which was noted during the time between trials. The number of learning opportunities is reduced when several seconds pass between trials. How slowly or quickly you provide instructions, often called pacing, has become increasingly important in ABA intervention. DTI can be done at a rapid rate. To maximize learning opportunities, probe data collection can replace trial-by- trial data collection. Other modi cations in data collection also can assist the teacher in maintaining the pace of instruction. MYTH DTI doesn t result in generalization  kids don t transfer their learning into everyday situations. FACT Discrete trial instruction initially is used to build basic skills and early discriminations. (Discrimination means knowing when to and when not to do something.) Sometimes, this phase of instruction is very methodical and does not contain much programming for generalization. However, for some learners, generalization is built into the program from the onset. And for all learners, generalization becomes a focus of instruction within DTI. It may be necessary to begin teaching a speci c skill under very speci c circumstances (same instruction, same therapist, and same reinforcer) to make it easier for the child to  rst learn the skill. Behavior analysts are always aware that the ultimate goal is for the child to be able to perform this skill in a variety of natural situations. At  rst, a discrete trial program may have only a few speci c strategies and over time become  looser  as additional circumstances are introduced into the teaching interaction. All learners need to be taught when to perform and when not to perform certain behaviors. Discrete trial instruction that incorporates strategies to enhance generalization can be a successful way to achieve these goals. MYTH DTI doesn t include child choice because the teacher determines the tasks, items used, and rewards. FACT This was historically true of DTI programs. However, intensive instruction has evolved. Today, learners are offered many choices in instruction. Preferences are considered when determining rewards to be offered and activities on which to work. In fact, preferences are continually assessed, to ensure that the learner is maximally motivated to participate in instruction. Furthermore, learners often choose the order of tasks they will work on, location of work, objects to be used for an activity, etc. MYTH Kids who experience a lot of DTI become little robots who know how to be compliant but not how to be creative. FACT At the beginning of a program, teachers ask the child for speci c responses, and may train in a very specialized way.

    "text": "Yes, it is true that individuals with autism exhibit repetitive behaviors in the form of motor mannerisms (hand  apping), object manipulations (lining up toy cars), language patterns (monotone voice or scripted conversation), and social behaviors (one track conversation). To varying extents, this may be a prominent characteristic that people observe about them. A goal of behavioral intervention is to constantly expand the skill repertoires of people with autism. Most importantly, anyone who knows someone with autism can tell you that he or she is creative in many different ways  MYTH As long as you have a curriculum, anyone can effectively conduct DTI. FACT A comprehensive curriculum is certainly an essential component of a child s education. However, it is not enough to ensure a successful academic experience. You need a great teacher to be a great student. Everyone knows the value of a good teacher who can make the material come  alive. Teachers who use an ABA approach are always looking for ways to maximize the student s progress by analyzing the student s performance and the elements in the teaching situation (the teacher s behavior, other students  behavior, the setting, the materials used, etc.). It is this analysis of the teaching process that is most likely to result in the most bene cial outcome for the student. The analysis tells the teacher important information so that he she can continue effective practices and discontinue ineffective practices on an ongoing basis. ABA Principles   Methods 22Many people in the autism community have been talking about  Verbal Behavior. Is it a part of ABA  Different from ABA  Better than ABA  What is Verbal Behavior  There sure has been a lot of verbal behavior about Verbal Behavior  To address these questions, here are some quick answers. 1. Given that ABA is the science of understanding and improving human behavior, ABA includes the analysis of verbal behavior. 2. Verbal behavior is synonymous with communicative behavior. Any interaction in which information is being conveyed is verbal behavior. Thus, verbal behavior includes both vocal means (saying a word) and non-vocal means (pointing and gesturing) of communication.Verbal Behavior 3. The analysis of verbal behavior is concerned with the functions of language including requests, comments, and conversation. Verbal Behavior is a system of classifying language that behavior analysts  nd very useful, both from a theoretical perspective (how we think about language) and from a practical perspective (how to teach language). The behavioral psychologist, B. F. Skinner, developed the Verbal Behavior classi cation system in 1957, and wrote about it in his book Verbal Behavior. Skinner was concerned with expressive language, which also can be described as direct communication with others. There are several Verbal Behavior categories especially relevant to teaching learners with autism. Examples follow each category. Echoic - imitating a sound, word, or phrase t Instructor says,  Say, ba  as she looks at a ball. Learner says  ba. Mand - making a request or demand t Learner reaches for a toy train (gesture) and says  choo choo  (speech). Tact - labeling something in the environment t A teacher holds up an eraser, and says,  What is it   The learner says,  eraser. Intraverbal - back and forth conversational exchange  talking about things or people not present t Joey says,  I saw a movie last night. Henry says,  What movie did you see   Joey says,  Finding Nemo. It s about a  sh. Henry says,  Cool. I saw that one, too. It was good. Verbal Behavior Classi cations ABA Principles   Methods 23It is important to recognize that Verbal Behavior is not an instructional methodology, but a framework for thinking about language development. This classi cation system is important because it also identi es different reinforcers for each type of verbal behavior. For example, the reinforcer for requesting something you want should be receiving that item you requested. This classi cation of language has been the framework of several interventions or teaching methodologies for learners with autism, including the Picture Exchange Communication System (PECS  Bondy   Frost, 2001  see page 28) and Natural Environment Training (NET  Sundberg   Partington, 1998  see page 27). The success of both intervention packages in building communication skills is impressive, and may be due, in part, to this attention to categories of communication. Bondy, A. S.,   Frost, L. A.

PECS is an alternative communication system in which an individual independently uses pictures to express his wants and needs. The PECS system utilizes behavioral principles and techniques such as motivation, prompting, shaping, differential reinforcement, reinforcer assessment, and transfer of stimulus control. One of the unique characteristics of the PECS program is that it teaches the learner to initiate an interaction with the listener. The pictures are kept in a notebook, and a learner is taught to create sentences by selecting pictures and delivering them to the communicative partner as a request for a desired item. PECS emphasizes teaching a learner to request items, respond to questions, and make social comments. Learners with autism often have de cits in these areas and bene t greatly from programming that targets these social skills. The goal of the  rst phase of PECS training is to teach a learner to initiate a Picture Exchange Communication System communication by approaching someone when he she wants or needs something. It is recommended to use two people  a listener and a prompter. When the learner reaches for a desired item, the prompter guides him her to pick up the picture with whatever assistance is necessary. Some learners may need a physical prompt  others may need a gestural prompt. Next, the individual reaches toward and places the picture in the open hand of the listener. During this phase of training, it is important that the prompter gradually fade the prompts over several opportunities. In phase two of PECS training, more naturalistic aspects of communication are introduced, the communicative partner gradually moves away, and pictures are further from the learner but still in plain sight. The goal is to teach the learner how to request items in all situations in which something is desired. In phase three, attention is devoted to teaching picture discriminations. Phases four,  ve, and six are advanced lessons within PECS. Phase four introduces sentence structure within the system.",

The procedure is broken down into the following steps  1. Child initiates for an item or activity. Initiation could be in the form of verbal language, sign language, picture exchange, gesturing, pointing, or leading. 2. Adult requests an elaboration in the form of a a. Non-verbal cue, such as shrugging shoulders, looking expectantly, or pointing to the item. b. Verbal cue, such as  What do you want   c. Verbal model, such as  Say, I want juice. 3. Child responds with a slightly better response than the  rst initiation. For example, attempting to name an object is better than only pointing to it 4. Adult provides the child with the requested object. (See the resources for suggestions on how to increase the number of correct and elaborated responses.) Fenske, E. C., Krantz, P.

The teacher notices the student s predicament and looks expectantly at him, waiting for him to ask for help. The child says,  Uh. Oh. The teacher says,  What do you need   The child says,  Straw. The teacher brings him a new straw. ABA Principles   Methods 27As you may have guessed from reading the previous sections, there are many combinations of antecedent-based interventions and consequence-based interventions that you can use to make a behavior more likely to happen. Parents typically use antecedents such as instructions. For example, a parent says,  Clean up your toys, please. The child is more likely to do so following the instruction than doing so on his own accord. After the child follows the instruction, the parent might offer a consequence such as praise,  Thanks for listening to Mommy. Now we can go outside to the swings   The clear instruction, verbal praise, and access to a preferred activity all work to increase the child s compliance. Many intervention packages do the same thing  they combine strategies to maximize a learner s progress. Behavior analysts who researched various teaching strategies were able to identify some of the most powerful ones. Then, they combined them into a package called Pivotal Response Training (PRT). PRT is a set of instructional strategies that can increase a learner s motivation and teach important skills. For learners with autism, this effect is extremely important. Oftentimes, learners with autism are not motivated to participate in social or educational interactions. When learners are motivated, they can learn so much more. PRT incorporates strategies that help parents and teachers make the most of the learner s skills and choices in everyday settings. Also, parents can learn how to use PRT during instructional time and throughout daily activities. Pivotal Response Training Furthermore, PRT targets skills that are important and useful in many activities. For example, PRT can build a set of behaviors such as imitation, compliance, and communication. There are seven (7) main points to remember  The question instruction opportunity to respond should  1. Be clear, uninterrupted, and appropriate to the task 2. Be interspersed with maintenance tasks (tasks the learner can already do with ease) 3.",

Of course, the speci c goals, materials, and settings will be individualized for the learner, as with all ABA interventions. PRT offers a set of strategies to keep learners paying attention and engaged. PRT episodes should be incorporated into planned and natural activities on a frequent basis (suggested rate is one episode every two minutes). The training also encourages learners to initiate their needs and wants and to respond to others. By providing the learner with choices of motivating items, mixing some new tasks with easy tasks, and rewarding attempts, a teacher can be both effective and fun. (Note  PRT is similar to Incidental Teaching and Mand Training within Natural Environment Training in their focus on choice, reinforcing attempts, and reinforcing contingently.) ABA Principles   Methods 29When you think about many of the tasks you perform on a daily basis, you realize how many steps are involved in each task. You may be even more aware of how many steps there are when you are learning something new, such as how to program your VCR. To learn this complex skill, you may watch someone else do it and write down all the steps. Or, you might closely follow the instructions in the manual. But what if those instructions weren t clear  You would need more information and more reinforcement for your attempts if you wanted to prevent frustration. The same is true for learners with autism. They also need clear instructions and plenty of reinforcement for accomplishing some, and eventually all, parts of a task. One of the ways behavior analysts do this is by creating and using a task analysis. A task analysis involves breaking a complex skill into smaller, teachable units. In creating a task analysis, an instructor creates a road map for how to teach a skill, step by step. There is ample bene t for the learner  access to reinforcement is much greater when the task is taught in this manner. An example of a task analysis is listed below. There are many ways to write a task analysis, and the same task could be described many different ways. A learner s skill level, preferences, and setting characteristics can in uence exactly how a task analysis is written. Arranging a place setting at the table could include the following steps  1. Put placemat on the table 2. Place plate on placematTask Analysis   Chaining 3. Place napkin on left side of plate 4. Place fork on napkin 5. Place knife on right side of plate 6. Place spoon on right side of plate 7. Place cup at top of plate This example assumes that all of the necessary items are within the learner s reach. This task analysis would be expanded further to include additional behaviors in order to get each of these items from their appropriate places. Similarly, this task analysis could be expanded to additional items, place settings, and other mealtime activities. It is relatively easy to create a task analysis. There are several methods you can use. One method is to perform the behavior yourself and take note of each step of the behavior. Alternately, you could watch another person perform the behavior. If you do this, select a person who can perform the skill well. In creating the task analysis, the steps of the behavior will be linked together to create a behavior chain.",

    "text": "Then, a task analysis assessment can then be done to evaluate what steps of the chain already are performed well by the learner. This enables the instructor to further individualize instruction by focusing on the steps that are not yet independent. When taught through chaining, it is important that the steps be taught in order. At times, chaining is taught using a forward chaining procedure in which the steps are targeted beginning with the  rst step. In the above example, the student would  rst be taught to put the placemat on the table independently. Reinforcement is provided for successfully completing this step. The teacher then assists the learner to put the ABA Principles   Methods 30plate on the placemat and complete the rest of the steps. When the learner can perform one step independently on a few occasions, the teacher requires that two steps be completed to earn reinforcement. Chaining also can be taught using a backward chaining procedure. In this approach to chaining, the individual is led through all the steps of the chain and  rst learns how to do the last step independently (placing the cup, in the above example). Then, the learner would achieve independence on the  nal two steps, and then the  nal three steps, and so on until the chain is completed independently. Backward chaining has an advantage over forward chaining in some situations. This advantage is the immediate availability of natural reinforcers for completing the last step. In the above example, after the learner places his cup on the table, dinner is served. Food and drink are great reinforcers. Another example is teaching a child to put on his coat before going outside to the swings. As soon as he completes the  nal step(s) of the backward chain (zipping the coat), he can run outside  This systematic approach offers many opportunities for the learner to become familiar with the task, the teacher to reinforce new skills, and both to enjoy the Task Analysis   Chaining process.

Increasing behaviors of persons with severe retardation and autism. Champaign, IL  Research Press.Resources ABA Principles   Methods 31Token Economy Take a moment to review the two types of reinforcers. Primary reinforcers meet a basic human need such as hunger, thirst, and warmth. Secondary reinforcers are learned over time because of their association with primary reinforcers. Secondary reinforcers could include smiles from loved ones, verbal praise, preferred toys, and money. As an example, a person goes to work everyday to earn money. At the end of the week, the person looks forward to receiving the paycheck. Why  Because money is a powerful secondary (generalized) reinforcer. Money can give you access to a wide variety of both primary (food and shelter) and secondary (leisure time and preferred items) reinforcers. Money is one example of a  token  in a token economy. A token economy makes use of secondary reinforcers to bridge the gap between a behavior and access to other reinforcers. Token economies can be comprehensive and positive motivational systems. For example, a student is supposed to stay in his seat for an entire thirty-minute class period but he has never done so. One possible intervention is a token economy in which he earns tokens for smaller amounts of time in which he is sitting appropriately. He could earn one token for every  ve minutes of appropriate sitting. If he earns  ve of the possible six tokens, he can choose an extra snack at lunch time or some other appropriate reinforcer. In this example, the student earns a token for appropriate sitting and learns to sit appropriately for longer amounts of time. Gradually, the teacher would increase the amount of time during which he had to sit appropriately to earn the tokens. A rule of thumb is to keep the program achievable and challenging, meaning that the student should be successful on most occasions as you encourage better performance. The token economy can also include a response cost component. A response cost means that if the student exhibits a response there is a cost. Using the above example, let s suppose the student was disruptive by throwing his pencil and papers on the  oor. After attempting various positive interventions, the team decided to add a response cost component to his token economy. Every time the student threw his pencil and papers on the  oor, a token was taken away. It is important to know that a response cost element is not recommended in the early stages of instruction in a token economy. As previously mentioned, token economies should be used as purely positive motivational systems whenever possible. It is also important to keep in mind other relevant guidelines for using behavior reduction procedures when implementing a response cost component.",

    "text": "Overall, token economies are a powerful and systematic tool to expand reinforcement options and delay the delivery of reinforcement to a more typical schedule. By doing so, we increase the types of reinforcers that will motivate learners with autism. Resource Ayllon, T. (1999). How to use token economy and point systems (2nd ed.). Austin, TX  PRO-ED. ABA Principles   Methods 32Activity Schedules Learning a new skill or keeping occupied during down time can be dif cult for learners with autism. What can you do to help them  An activity schedule is a tool that they can use to help promote their independence during play, leisure, and academic time. An activity schedule is a set of pictures or words that cues a sequence of activities. Additionally, schedules help to promote choice and can set the occasion for initiations to others. Typical materials for an activity schedule include a photo album or three-ring binder, stickers, activity photos, and a preferred item that will serve as a reinforcer for accomplishing the task. Learners are likely to be successful with an activity schedule when they can consistently accomplish the following prerequisite skills  t identify pictures versus background  t match identical objects  t match picture to object  t accept guidance  t use materials appropriately  and t obtain materials from a different location. When selecting activities, keep in mind that they must be familiar or mastered by the learner with autism because you are teaching how to complete the sequence of the activities, not the actual tasks. The activities should be age appropriate and have a clear ending. Toys such as play-do or building blocks are not recommended at  rst because they do not have a clear ending. Initial items could include puzzles, nesting cups, stacking rings, etc. The schedule should end with a snack or a preferred activity (for example, tickles from a parent). Much of the work leading up to a successful activity schedule experience is preparation. Behavior analysts prepare the materials, rewards, and tokens and organize the environment to display the materials in a visible and accessible manner. Over time, the learner will progress from prompted interaction with the materials to spontaneous interaction coupled while following the schedule. As is true for all ABA interventions, the goal is to make the learner as independent as possible so that he she can complete the activity, ask for assistance when needed, and enjoy his her new abilities. The  ve basic steps in the activity schedule process are as follows  turn to a page, point to the photograph, obtain the materials, complete the activity, and put away the materials. The instructor provides and fades prompts based on the learner s progress and delivers rewards on the same basis. Oftentimes, beginning learners need frequent reinforcement to stay motivated and on track. The use of an activity schedule does not have to be limited to playing with toys or completing academic tasks. Some clinicians have had great success teaching children and adults with autism how to socialize with their peers using an activity schedule in the initial stages of programming. The ability to follow an activity schedule brings many bene ts to the learner such as independence and choice. It can also be generalized to many types of daily activities for learners of all ages.

ABA Principles   Methods 33Precision Teaching with Rate Building Precision Teaching (PT) is an area of ABA that has been practiced and researched for many years. In fact, PT is a form of ABA instruction that has been widely used with typical and learning-challenged populations, with great results. It is only recently, in fact, that PT has been signi cantly extended to learners with autism. Precision Teaching focuses on building the rate at which learners can demonstrate skills, and focuses on the attainment of  uency. Fluency refers to the combination of accuracy plus speed that characterizes competent performance. When people are  uent in skills, they can do them effortlessly and  uidly. They appear quite expert at them. Think about how you drive or make a sandwich. You do not think through every element of those tasks  you can perform them easily and with little or no attention to executing each movement. Sometimes, learners with autism can exhibit skills, but are not  uent at them. If compared to how others did those tasks, it often looks more laborious and takes more time to do the tasks compared to a  uent and competent peer. Precision Teaching (sometimes called Fluency-Based Instruction) is a method of building response rates and developing  uency in a variety of skill areas.",

    "text": "When PT is applied to learners with autism, there is a focus on the rate of skill demonstration and use of a speci c measuring system to chart student progress. (This system is known as the Standard Celeration Chart.) In addition to addressing issues such as long response times (often called latency to respond) and rate of skill demonstration, PT addresses de cits in component skills which can impede progress on more complex tasks. How does Precision Teaching work  Attention is paid to the rate at which the learner can perform the task. Generally, PT is done in short sprints, to increase rate of skill performance. Teaching includes timed practices in which the learner is expected to reach a speci c goal. These goals are often referred to as performance aims and demonstrate the learner s  uency with a skill. In addition, attention is paid to the concept of component skills, which are building block skills for more complex skills. For example, component skills include reaching, pointing, and grasping, which could all impact on skills such as matching or identifying objects. Often, PT with rate-building focuses on the development of core motor skills that assist the learner in performing many other more complex tasks. Of course, PT with rate building can also be used to teach complex skills, as long as the foundation skills are already  rmly established.Resources Binder, C. (1996).

ABA Principles   Methods 34There are several ways to determine target rates. There are some resources available with normed rates, including a set from learners on the autism spectrum, collected by Fabrizio   Moors. When no target rate is available, typical peers can be sampled to determine a target range. Examples of skills that might be targeted via PT with rate-building are motor skills such as grasping, reaching, placing, and pulling as well as other skills such as matching pictures and answering questions. Precision Teaching with Rate Building Example 2 Alternately, a child might be working on pointing. (Assume the learner knows how to point and is now working on pointing more rapidly and independently.) Teacher   Ok, Sally, it is time to do pointing. Remember go as fast as you can. You see your chart  We are trying to get to the red line. Ready, set, go. Learner  points rapidly in succession. Teacher provides coaching encouragement along the way. Teacher (at end of interval notices that the child did not meet her goal)   Great try, Sally. Let s do it again, and I ll help this time. The teacher might then perform a guided practice to help the learner understand the target rate. The maximum number of timings conducted on a single day is10 (although timings are not successive and cease whenever the daily goal is reached). If success is not achieved, adjustments are made in instruction to increase success on the following day.Example 1 A learner working on identifying pictures could begin a session as follows (Assume the learner already had suf cient prompting and practice, has the component skills, and is now performing independently.) Teacher   Ok, Sammy. It s time to do your pictures. Remember go as fast as you can. Your goal is 15. Ready, set, go. Learner  rapidly labels items on table. T eacher provides coaching encouragement along the way. At the end of the interval the timer goes off and the teacher counts 16 correct. She says,  Terri c. You met your goal. Hooray   The teacher would then indicate that the goal has been met on the chart, and would make adjustments in instruction for the next day (e.g., lengthening the timing). When the student has met the goal in the terminal timing length (e.g., 1 minute) or at an earlier point in instruction if performance warrants it, the teacher would assess whether the student can demonstrate the skill with novel materials (application), in the face of distraction (stability), and for longer periods of time (endurance). If all of those criteria are met, the skill would not be practiced for about a month, and then a retention check would be conducted.

    "text": "All of the parents questioned what behaviors were  because of the autism  and what behaviors were typical of children their age. These parents shared their stories about when the behavior occurred, what might have set off the problem, and the aftermath. One parent told of the following episode. Mandy said,  We were at my four-year- old nephew s party and there was so much noise. My sister had about twenty kids running all over her house. David was actually doing pretty well. I thought it was going to be a rough day for him so I brought some of his favorite toys. After being there for about two hours, it was time to sing  Happy Birthday. Well, David just couldn t hold on any longer. He ran over to my husband and covered his ears as he screamed at the top of his lungs. People couldn t really hear him during the song but, ooohh, did they get an earful once the song was over. We had to bring him into another room to calm him down. We talked to him softly and reminded him that his favorite toys were nearby. I know we gave him a lot of attention for screaming but we didn t have too many other options given the situation. Luckily, my sister and her friends know David and the party continued during our little episode. I wonder how he s going to do at my friend s daughter s party next month. The great news is that this parent remembered so much information about the situation. She could use this information to  gure out how to make it better for the next time. First, behavior analysts  nd out why the problem behavior is happening by writing down what happened before and after the behavior. Events that occur well before the behavior include a full night s sleep, medication, diet, and interactions with others. These are formally known as setting events. It makes sense that setting events change the likelihood of a behavior occurring. Behavior analysts also write down the antecedents and the consequences of the behavior. This is called ABC data because information is collected on the antecedents (A), behaviors (B), and consequences (C). Second, they review many ABC episodes individually and together to look for a pattern. Third, they use that pattern to predict when the behavior is likely and unlikely to happen. Next, they take an educated guess about what is reinforcing or maintaining the behavior. This is called the function of the behavior, the purpose the behavior serves, or how the person communicates his wants and needs through this behavior. Lastly, they use this information to change the setting events, antecedents, and consequences. By doing so, we carefully encourage and reinforce appropriate behavior more often than the problem behavior. While some of this initially takes more work, the end results are often great. Going back to the birthday party example, Mandy noted some things that happened before and after David screamed. With the guidance of a behavior analyst, she wrote this information down so they could look at it together. The above information told Mandy a number of things about David s behavior and how she might go about decreasing it. First, David was provided with attention from one or both parents following all three screaming episodes. Second, all episodes of the behavior were very intense. When ABA Principles   Methods 36David screamed, he was loud and visibly distraught. Third, David was often not receiving a lot of attention from his parents before the behavior. When Mandy looked at this information laid out in front of her, she was surprised to see these patterns emerged. She knew that she and her husband were loving parents who gave David a lot of attention throughout the day. Why was he screaming when he didn t have their attention  The behavior analyst pointed out that David wanted to be around them because they were so responsive to his needs, as good parents are. They have provided much reinforcement throughout David s life and as a result, he highly valued their attention. The team was well on its way to  guring out what to do to improve the situation. They knew one of David s possible reinforcers was attention from Mom and Dad. The behavior analyst asked the parents how they could more carefully use their attention to increase David s appropriate behavior. The parents decided to provide David with attention when he was acting appropriately  perhaps doing so before David was likely to scream might prevent the behavior altogether. The behavior analyst thought this was a great idea and added one more. The parents could also teach David an easy way to communicate what he wanted. While he could say some words some of the time, he often didn t use his words when he was overwhelmed or frustrated. Providing him with easy ways, such as hand signals, to quickly communicate that he wanted to leave a situation or ask for attention could also lessen the chance of the screaming behavior happening again.",

By analyzing this information and changing the behavior s antecedents and consequences, a person s response can be greatly improved. Typically, behavior analysts gather functional assessment information in two ways  interviewing people who know the learner and observing actual episodes of the behavior to collect ABC data. Sometimes, this information is not enough to hypothesize a function of the behavior and develop a treatment plan that is likely to be successful. In these instances, a process known as functional analysis may be conducted. Conducting a functional analysis requires a behavior analyst with knowledge and experience in the implementation of this complex process.

Doing so allows the team to see when the behavior is likely and unlikely to happen. Often, this information is suf cient to understand the problem behavior and begin intervention planning. Expertise in conducting functional analyses is essential to ensure that the challenging behavior is managed safely and effectively throughout the assessment process. The take-home message of functional assessment is that all challenging behavior is seen as communication. The individual is telling us something. The next time an individual engages in challenging behavior, the information gathering described above will help create a better situation. ABA Principles   Methods 38As you have learned by reading the previous sections, behavior analysts attempt to change what happens before and after a behavior to make it more or less likely to occur. You have read about theoretical principles and speci c antecedent and consequence strategies to change behavior. Clearly, modern ABA encompasses a wide variety of techniques. While there was a heavy emphasis on consequence-based strategies in the past, researchers and clinicians are now learning more about how to change behavior in more sophisticated ways. Let us now look more closely at antecedent- based interventions. This focus on changing the environment before a behavior occurs is advantageous for several reasons. First, in the situation of challenging behavior, the goal is to prevent the behavior. We may achieve prevention by using antecedent-based strategies. Second, the search for effective antecedent-based strategies can improve our understanding of the learner s experiences. For example, suppose a learner tantrums when transitioning from one teacher to another. We observe the teachers  styles to identify any possible differences that would predict tantrum. It is noted that the learner behaves more appropriately for the teacher who speaks at a slower pace. The other teacher then speaks slowly and the learner s tantrums stop.",

    "text": "While not all assessment and intervention plans will go so smoothly, this example illustrates that antecedent- intervention can be more desirable than consequence-based intervention Antecedent-Based Interventions for some situations. Third, a thorough assessment of the context can lead to endless possibilities for intervention. Possibilities include offering choices in the types, number, and order of tasks  altering the demand by reducing the effort required  mixing easy and hard tasks  reducing distractions  increasing visual supports  and incorporating the student s preferences. Joey often throws his worksheet halfway through his assignment. His teacher is perplexed, especially since he can do the work. One day, she notices that there is no problem when a  re drill interrupts them halfway through the period. Later that day, Joey  nishes the worksheet without incident. The teacher decides ask Joey to do just a few problems on the worksheet. She gives him a choice of other activities. Later in the day, he completes the worksheet. Breaking the task up reduces the monotony and increases Joey s cooperation. In the future, the teacher will work on maintaining Joey s motivation while slowly increasing the amount of work she expects.Example 1 ABA Principles   Methods 39Example 3 While antecedent-based interventions are crucial to preventing challenging behavior, these strategies can also be helpful when teaching new skills. Danny, a teenager with autism, was not able to tell the difference between the men s and women s restroom signs. His father tried to teach him this by typing the relevant words and printing them in a large font. After a week of instruction, his father realized that Danny was not independently identifying these two signs. He still needed his father s help. His father incorporated an antecedent- based strategy  he changed the teaching materials. This time, his father used stick  gure drawings commonly used on restroom doors to depict a man and a woman. With a few days of teaching, Danny could independently identify these signs.Antecedent-Based Interventions Prior to her teachers using an antecedent-based strategy, Melissa screams when she is randomly paired with Barbara (another student) to complete a task. Melissa verbally and physically protests throughout the task. Barbara does not like listening to Melissa scream. Barbara says to the teacher,  Maybe you should let her pick her own partner next time. The teacher does just that. The next time Melissa does not protest  The incorporation of choice-making improves Melissa s behavior and avoids a problematic scene.Example 2 Resources Glasberg, B. A.

ABA Principles   Methods 40meaningful goals are developed for the individual, to put the individual in more contact with people and experiences they  nd rewarding, and that increase the positive aspects of their relationships. Comprehensive multi-component interventions are another feature of PBS plans. They program for success by addressing many related issues and skills. Someone who is having dif culty with completing assigned work might have components of a plan that include asking for a break, assistance with dif cult tasks, choosing the order and location of tasks, interspersing solitary work and social time, and responding appropriately to feedback on performance. PBS often inspires people to make small, yet creative and important, shifts in various aspects of teaching. Perhaps a person will learn more effectively if given a peer buddy or allowed to take breaks from work to go outdoors several times throughout the day. Sometimes, a team can generate some strategic changes in scheduling, locations, roles, or staff assignments to maximize the success and happiness of the individual with autism. The combination of individual and systems change can produce effective, durable, and meaningful outcomes for all involved. There is considerable overlap between ABA and PBS. Virtually all applied behavior analysts agree with the social values emphasized in PBS. Similarly, proponents of PBS rely heavily on ABA methods and research design to improve When a person with a disability is aggressive or self-injurious, it is dangerous for the person and those around him or her. Planning and careful responding are required to safely and effectively reduce the dangerous behavior. Fortunately, there are many things a team can do to 1) understand why the behavior is happening, 2) teach the individual how to act more appropriately, and 3) improve the individual s quality of life.",

    "text": "Positive Behavior Support (PBS) accomplishes these three things by combining well-researched assessment and intervention strategies of ABA with the social values of personal choice, independence, community integration, systems change, and quality of life. Quality of life is embedded into PBS. It incorporates person-centered planning in all possible aspects of intervention and is focused on the individual and on his or her quality of life. The individual with autism is included in the intervention planning process. Preferences are taken into account in a variety of ways, including tasks to work on and leisure pursuits. Choice is of central importance, and every element of programming is sensitive to the inclusion of choice wherever possible. PBS also includes all stakeholders in the process by incorporating their input into the development of a plan. Parents  input is actively solicited and used to make an appropriate plan that can easily be implemented at home and in the community. Whenever possible, the individual with autism has a voice in the development of goals and plans.

There is some debate in the  eld regarding the nature of PBS as separate from ABA or as an outgrowth of ABA. For our purposes in this manual, PBS is a well-researched methodology that provides effective and comprehensive measures to help individuals with challenging behavior and those around them. ABA Principles   Methods 42When teaching learners with autism, we have to plan for generalization to occur. One way to convey that is to say,  We cannot just teach and hope. While teaching a new skill is certainly the  rst step, there are likely to be many more steps in teaching when to do the skill, when not to, and how to behave just right in a particular situation. The learning process is not complete until widespread generalization has occurred in meaningful situations.Generalization Generalization occurs when a person learns something in one environment and can independently apply it in another. Spontaneous generalization occurs when the learner can do so without any additional training. Learners with autism often have a dif cult time generalizing skills to new environments. They may need more intensive teaching to learn how to exhibit new skills outside of the teaching situation. While it may be important to teach new skills in a controlled manner, it is also important to make sure that the person can use the skill in a functional and meaningful way. There are three main types of generalization. Stimulus generalization means that the learner can respond the same way with different cues in place. For example, drivers stop at red lights and stop signs. When a driver stops for a policeman directing traf c, the driver has demonstrated stimulus generalization. The driver had the same response even though the cue (stimulus) was different. Response generalization means that a learner exhibits different responses in the same situations. For example, a teacher says good morning to her student. On Monday, the student responds with a wave. On Tuesday, the student acknowledges the teacher s greeting with eye contact and a smile. The student exhibited a different response even though the situation was the same. The third type of generalization is generalization over time, also known as maintenance. This refers to the ability to demonstrate skills long after responses are no longer reinforced as they were in the training setting. Generalization and maintenance refer to the learner s performance for both skill acquisition and behavior reduction goals.Stimulus Generalization 1. The mailman greets the child, saying,  Hi. How are you   2. The child says,  Fine. This skill has only been taught in Discrete Trial Instruction at school. 3. You have taught the child to ask,  Can I have a turn   when others have highly preferred toys at home. At a family gathering at his aunt s house, he asks a cousin,  Can I have a turn   ABA Principles   Methods 43Generalization Resources Maintenance 6.

Journal of Applied Behavior Analysis, 10, 349-367. ABA Principles   Methods 44Evaluation of ABA Programs Data Collection and Analysis Data are collected within an ABA program for multiple purposes. Data inform the decisions we make about programming. Data are taken to document both the acquisition of skills and the improvement in challenging behaviors. Here are some of the most common ways to collect data. Frequency How often, for example, the number of times a learner requests a toy   ve times Rate How often within a certain amount of time. For example, the number of times a learner requests a toy within a twenty -minute class period -  ve times in twenty minutes equals 0.25 times per minute. One advantage of converting frequency to rate is that you can take data for different amounts of time and still be able to evenly compare the number of times a behavior occurred.Duration How long. For example, the length of time that a preschooler sits appropriately during circle time - three minutes. Intensity How severe. For example, a tantrum could range from mild to severe. As one might imagine, there are some behaviors that are better tracked by one method than another. For advantages and disadvantages for each type data, please see the resource section below. Data analysis involves graphing the data and analyzing the following elements  Level (How much is the behavior happening ). Trend (Is the behavior increasing, decreasing, or maintaining ). 45Stability (Are the behaviors  data points  close together or highly variable ). The level, trend, stability, and other information about the behavior are then used to make decisions about appropriate interventions and goals for performance. Before an intervention begins, behavior analysts collect information about the behavior. This is called baseline data. Baseline data are collected on both challenging behaviors and targeted skills. Data are then collected during the course of an intervention to determine if the learner is making progress, how much progress, and if modi cations to the intervention plan are necessary. One hallmark characteristic of ABA is ongoing data collection. While you can take data every time a behavior occurs, it is not necessary to do so. There are many ef cient and reliable means of collecting  probe  (occasional) data that do not require continuous  trial by trial  data recording. One goal is to collect as much data as possible without detracting from the teaching interaction. These data are important when making decisions about what and how to teach. Data guide instructors on a constant basis. Demonstration of a functional relation Another hallmark characteristic of ABA is the demonstration of a systematic relation between two variables. For example, if a learner had a tantrum when and only when there was a change in the class schedule, one might suspect the schedule change caused the tantrum. A behavior analyst would explore this possible connection to determine if these events simply occurred together in time or if one caused the other. Behavior analysts identify relations between variables and use this information to change the environment and behavior in the most positive and ef cient way possible. Evaluation of ABA Programs 46Running an Intensive ABA Program ABA intervention is a complex and multi-faceted endeavor. A good ABA program is intensive, individualized, and comprehensive. Intensive A good ABA program provides intensive teaching. Intensity usually means a low teacher to student ratio (one teacher for one or two students), a large number of instructional hours, and many learning opportunities. People often ask,  How many hours   Most experts recommend 30 to 40 hours.",

    "text": "(Recall that naturalistic teaching done throughout activities can be counted as hours if there is a systematic focus on the development of skills at these times.) Individualized A good ABA program will be highly individualized. It will not be a cookbook or one-size- ts-all approach. The foundation of individualization is the assessment process. Initially, a thorough and comprehensive assessment is done to help understand the learner s areas of strengths and de cits. The assessment itself will be individualized in terms of the types of instruments used and tested skills. A good assessment offers critical information to answer the question  Where should we start teaching  During the course of an intervention, a learner s progress is analyzed in order to support him her in the most positive and effective ways possible. Children with autism are quite different from one another  their programs should re ect this diversity. Comprehensive A good ABA program will incorporate several of the instructional methods that comprise ABA. For example, a program that only utilizes DTI will not allow enough 47opportunities for spontaneity. Since different instructional methods have distinct advantages, there are reasons to use multiple methods of instruction to ensure that a wide range of skills are taught. Who can put together a comprehensive ABA program  Credentialed professionals in Applied Behavior Analysis are in the best position to provide comprehensive ABA services.

However, given the neurological limitations that autism imposes, parents may need additional skills to effectively teach their children. ABA methods offer many strategies for assessment and intervention. It is recommended that parents learn as much as they can about ABA. While increasing your  ABA repertoire  will bene t your child and your family, each parent has to decide how much they want to know and do. One parent may be comfortable knowing the basic terminology and a few skills to follow up on what the child is learning in school. Another parent may read volumes of literature and  live and breathe  ABA. Other parents may fall somewhere in between by having a good understanding of ABA, working with the school on speci c skills, and implementing consistent ABA strategies at home to reinforce appropriate behavior throughout the day. For those parents who want to learn ABA methods, we recommend starting with the following  reinforcement, shaping, and mand training (in the Natural Environment Training section). These strategies are likely to increase your child s appropriate behavior and motivation.

Sibshops  Workshops for siblings of children with special needs. Baltimore, MD  Brookes Publishing.This section addresses administrative issues. As previously noted, intensive programs for learners with autism can be intense experiences for those who are responsible for them. This section highlights some of the common issues parents face when maintaining a home program. There are some advantages and disadvantages to having a child s education take place at home. The issues presented will be helpful in determining if a home program is appropriate for an individual family. When a child goes to school, there is a natural separation of home and school life. The teacher does not enter the home, or at least not on a regular basis. A home-based program presents very differently. Teaching is taking place where the child and family live. If a dif cult discussion needs to take place with the teacher, it may happen in the living room or at the kitchen table. The natural separation of home and school that is inherent in sending a child to a school evaporates. Everything happens at home. Alternatively, this could be seen as a good thing. Communication may be more regular and thorough, and it may not require a scheduled meeting. From the child s perspective, there are learning opportunities throughout the day. For young children, this learning would occur in the most natural setting   his her home. The child has plenty of opportunities to learn, use, and generalize new skills in a functional manner across people and settings. Frequently in the home program, opportunities for social development require more planning than in a school. Arranging play dates can take on a new meaning when the child has beginner-level play and social skills. There are also factors to consider related to the staff of the program. The home environment may cause some professionals to behave more casually than they would in a classroom. This puts some parents at ease, while others  nd it unprofessional. Parents should be aware of their preferences and make them known to their child s instructors. Perhaps these expectations should be included in their performance appraisals. The Autism Special Interest Group of the Association for Behavior Analysis has created guidelines for consumers of ABA services. This document may be helpful in selecting behavior analysts and reviewing their performance with standard criteria in mind. The information gathered from both informal and formal sources can be used in a systematic way to determine the feedback, incentives, and raises that are provided for the child s instructors. Some parents welcome this opportunity and are very comfortable in the role of employer. Others rise to the occasion with mixed feelings along the way. The program supervisor can largely determine the quality of the home program. He she sets the tone for professionalism, communication, collaboration, and the integrity of the ABA program itself. Service delivery coordination and  nancial arrangements with state early intervention programs, local school districts, and state of ces for individuals with developmental disabilities are substantial tasks that are beyond the scope of this book. There are also implications for siblings when a home-based program is in effect.",

    "text": "ABA and the Family 52Running a Home-based ABA ProgramMany siblings enjoy the presence of another caring and fun adult. However, it is also common for siblings to become jealous of their brother or sister s  special friend. Often, a sibling s perspective can be improved by giving them a comfortable role (participating in turn taking or a circle time activity). Letting siblings see what happens with the instructor can go a long way to increase their comfort level and reduce negative feelings. Of course, a sibling s participation should be entirely voluntary. Parents and instructors should take their lead from the sibling and create an experience tailored to his or her level of interest and concerns. Running a home-based instructional program is an enormous undertaking. Parents assume central roles not just in the instruction of their child, but also in the management of an educational team. ABA and the Family 51Running a Home-based ABA ProgramABA as a Profession We have provided a lot of information in this book. Yet, this is only a fraction of the ABA knowledge base. Professionals in this  eld are responsible for knowing how to successfully implement a wide range of assessment, intervention, and quality assurance methods. To do so requires extensive training including academic coursework, hands-on experience, and supervision. A national certi cation is well underway to ensure a minimum level of competence for those who practice ABA. This certi cation became available on a national level in 1999 and is a major advancement for the profession and for consumers of ABA services. The criteria for this certi cation offer guidelines for consumers when choosing a behavior analyst. The following resources offer many speci c quali cations for behavior analysts and those they supervise. A few basic skills are worthy of mention in this overview of ABA to foster your identi cation of the major areas of competence within behavior analysis. A behavior analyst should  1. Spend time with the learner and those who play a role in his educational programming (parents, teachers, etc.) in order to gain an appreciation of the learner s preferences and skills and the team s values and goals. 2. Observe the learner on multiple occasions to become familiar with what the learner can do with and without intervention. 3. Conduct objective assessments that capture a true picture of the behavior. 554. Implement (or train others to implement) an intervention that is acceptable to the team, individualized for the learner, increases appropriate behavior, and makes a meaningful difference in the learner s life. 5. Collect and analyze data to be able to describe the learner s progress and to ensure service accountability. 6. Overall, act in accordance with the Behavior Analyst Certi cation Board  (BACB) Professional Disciplinary Standards  and Guidelines for Responsible Conduct for Behavior Analysts . The skills noted in numbers 1-5 above are basic level skills. Good behavior analysts practice within the conduct guidelines mentioned in number 6. Please refer to these guidelines to become familiar with ABA s professional expectations and standards. While many quali ed behavior analysts serve learners with autism, the demand for ABA services far exceeds the supply. Given this low supply and high demand state, many under-quali ed or unquali ed providers are well positioned to offer their services. It is important to mention that all professionals who utilize ABA methods should comply with the standards of the profession. For example, many people who provide  ABA services  only know how to use a particular curriculum or training protocol. This professional should provide that information to the consumer by detailing his her training experiences and by referring to another professional for services beyond that topic. This professional should not assume that one particular curriculum or treatment protocol is appropriate for all learners nor withhold information about more comprehensive programs.

Austin, TX  PRO-ED.Myths   Facts Top Ten Misconceptions of ABA To complete this overview of ABA, it may be helpful to review some of the popular misconceptions about what ABA is and is not. Often an approach can be minimized, discounted, or incorrectly described by people with minimal information or misinformation. When this happens, people can get the wrong idea about what an approach represents, how effective an approach is, who an approach is appropriate for, etc. ABA has been subject to many misconceptions for a variety of reasons. Below are some of the misconceptions that parents and professionals are most likely to hold about ABA. MYTH ABA is a one-size- ts-all approach.FACT ABA is highly individualized in every way Behavior analysts begin by assessing an individual s skills and develop learning objectives. From the goals selected to the methods used, ABA is focused on maximizing an individual s performance. By observing a person s behavior and collecting objective data, behavior analysts are able to monitor progress and adjust interventions on a daily basis. ABA teaching is a very dynamic process. MYTH ABA increases compliance and some other skills but does not address  higher-level  skills such as play and social skills. 57FACT ABA can be used to build skills in all areas, including abstract thought and social skills. Common objectives include reciprocal conversation, joining a game, and problem- solving skills. MYTH ABA results in similar outcomes for all individuals with autism. FACT Autism is a neurobiological disorder that is evident in a person s behavior. ABA can signi cantly impact a person s behavior by teaching him new skills, sometimes to the extent that he can become indistinguishable from his peers. For the majority of individuals with autism who do not  recover,  they do make substantial progress throughout their lives as a result of ABA. MYTH There is evidence that other approaches are just as effective as ABA. FACT According to the information available at this time, ABA is the only approach with substantial, documented evidence of its effectiveness for learners with autism. Behavior analysts have conducted systematic research and provided documented, peer-reviewed evidence of its effectiveness for thousands of people. In addition, the documentation of ABA s effectiveness covers many types of interventions, age groups, and skill levels. The proponents of other approaches have limited or no objective data to demonstrate improvement for learners with autism. MYTH An intensive ABA program is a guarantee that a child will be able to enter kindergarten without supports. FACT There is a range of outcomes for learners in intensive ABA intervention. Some children enter into inclusive settings part-time and still receive some specialized instruction in another setting. Some children continue to need specialized and intensive services in a full day program. Other children enter into full-time kindergarten settings, but require supports such as a shadow (an instructional assistant assigned just to them or to several children with special needs) or a speech therapist. And some children do attend full-time regular education without supports. Most importantly, while it may be tempting to equate a child s educational placement with success or failure, it often is more meaningful to look at a child s progress on multiple dimensions. MYTH Intensive ABA is no longer justi ed when children are past pre-school age. FACT ABA has received tremendous recognition for the impact at the pre-school level. However, it remains the best documented and effective approach for older learners as well. This is so because it is a science based on the principles of human behavior, which span all age and ability ranges. MYTH ABA consists mostly of compliance training, resulting in children who are resistant to Myths   Facts 58learning and tantrum to escape learning situations. FACT Historically, compliance training was used a great deal in ABA. We now know much more about how to motivate behavior, and compliance is gained in many positive ways. In a good ABA program, children are very fond of their instructors, eagerly anticipate learning, and enjoy their instructional time. MYTH ABA uses a lot of punishment. FACT This is a very serious issue and will be answered in two parts. a. Punishment is NEVER used as part of a teaching program. ABA always uses items and activities that motivate learners to participate in instruction. Increasing appropriate behavior is the major focus of all ABA programs. b. When an individual exhibits challenging behaviors that place the individual or others in danger, a treatment team must carefully and effectively respond to reduce the behavior.",

    "text": "Comprehensive positive behavioral supports (see page 41) should be utilized to the fullest extent to reduce dangerous behavior through assessment and positive interventions. Most of the time, positive approaches suf ciently reduce the dangerous behavior. The use of punishment procedures is a last resort. Most punishment procedures are consistent with techniques that parents use with typically developing children such as verbal reprimands and loss of 59 Myths   Factsprivileges. If punishment procedures are used, they should be done so very cautiously, with full consent of parents, and with procedural safeguards to ensure bene t to the individual. Using behavior reduction procedures without informed consent and documented effectiveness is unacceptable. All parents should  nd out how their child s behavior is addressed and discuss the procedures for which you would and would not provide consent. For more information on guidelines for the use of behavior reduction procedures, please see Autism New Jersey s Position Statement on the Use of Restrictive Procedures within Comprehensive Behavior Support Plans (see resource section). This position statement advocates for the extinction or limited use of punishment procedures. It outlines extensive procedural safeguards for the safe and effective use of punishment procedures within the contexts of behavior plans and crisis management, should they be deemed necessary by a treatment team. While clinicians and legislators continue to discuss the merits of regulating such procedures as a component of a plan or crisis management, the individual s rights and safety are primary concerns. MYTH ABA is limited to one or a few speci c strategies, such as Discrete Trial Instruction. FACT ABA incorporates many strategies to improve people s abilities and quality of life. Sometimes these strategies are grouped together by practitioners and Resourcesgiven a speci c name. On a similar note, the procedures used at particular schools are sometimes labeled the same name as the school. Given society s tendency to put things into categories, it is important to keep in mind that every learner with autism requires an individualized educational plan. Behavior analysts should use their knowledge and experience to create and monitor such a plan. Doing so may require using a combination of strategies that have research support. You should proceed with caution with any professional who knows only one set of strategies or  brand  of ABA. MYTH All professionals are created equal and all explain ABA in the same way. FACT All professionals do not receive equivalent training. In fact, there is some variability in the training of behavior analysts and even greater variability in the training of behavioral  consultants. Be wary of taking one professional s perspective. Obtain a second opinion, if necessary. In terms of using the same terminology, many behavior analysts do. However, there are many examples of similar strategies with different names and slightly different components. Hopefully, this book will make these similarities and differences more clear.

Position statement on the use of restrictive procedures within comperhensive behavior support plans. Robbinsville, NJ  Author. Available at www.autismnj.org.Summary ABA is a powerful teaching technology for learners with autism. During the past several decades, it has become more sophisticated and more complex. There are a wide variety of instructional strategies, each of which has a distinct purpose and unique advantages. A comprehensive ABA program addresses the range of de cits that learners exhibit and utilizes a wide array of these instructional strategies. All of the strategies discussed in this book are compatible and can be included together in a comprehensive intervention package. What makes it ABA  Regardless of which instructional strategy is being used, the following elements characterize an ABA program. 1. Assessment  Behavior analysts conduct a thorough initial assessment and continual assessment of behavior change over time. Assessment is the  rst step in every ABA endeavor and remains a constant presence in every program. Assessment is not a one-shot deal but instead a regular feature in the ABA process. 2. A link between assessment and intervention  Intervention is guided by assessment and is individualized to the learner s unique needs. 3. Data-based decision making  Data are collected and analyzed to evaluate how a learner is doing on a particular program.",

    "text": "Decisions about what to do next are determined by rate of progress and other objective indicators of progress, not on someone s impression or pre-determined criteria. 4. Dynamic and responsive programming  The constant data collection and analysis allows for dynamic programming. Learners should not 61be distressed, fail to attain skills, or exhibit increasing rates of challenging behaviors. Such problems signal to the behavior analyst that a change in instruction is warranted. 5. Social signi cance  The issues addressed should be socially signi cant  they should make real differences in the lives of people served and should increase their access to rewarding activities. At its core, ABA is focused on helping people make meaningful progress.What is the message  The goal of ABA intervention is to build socially signi cant behaviors in a meaningful way and to a meaningful degree. The broad array of ABA interventions helps us accomplish this important goal. Generalization and spontaneity are essential components of successful intervention. The ultimate goal is the demonstration of skills in natural contexts leading to richer personal and social experiences.

    "text": "Autism 101 for educators  How general education teachers can support students with ASD One in 31 children in the United States is diagnosed with autism. More are enrolled in general education classrooms in school than ever before. The good news  inclusion has universal benefits. It has been known to improve educational outcomes for all students, overall attitudes towards diversity and even school attendance rates. The bad news  most general education teachers lack sufficient autism-related instruction. Many teacher-education programs require just one overview class about students with disabilities. On-the-job professional development specific to autism is nearly non-existent and rarely mandatory. As a result, even the best teachers can be unsure how to properly support their autistic students. Some even struggle to understand autism. Ethan Hirschberg experienced this in high school. The autistic teen was having a hard time keeping up in a well-respected teacher s class. Frustrated, the teacher asked,  What are you, autistic   A heartbroken, embarrassed Ethan responded,  yes. It is worth noting that the teacher apologized and worked with Ethan to learn better about him and autism. But there is too much at risk for all involved to leave it solely up to teachers to learn about autism on the job. Here, we provide general education teachers with a primer on autism to promote awareness and acceptance and to help create an inclusive classroom environment that not only supports autistic students but the entire class. But the learning does not stop and start with one teacher in one classroom. It is imperative that parents, teachers and school administrators share this with physical education teachers, art teachers, music teachers, guidance counselors and throughout their schools. Autism 101  Facts about autism spectrum disorder What is autism  Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), refers to a broad range of conditions characterized by challenges with social skills, repetitive behaviors, speech and nonverbal communication. It is diagnosed by a qualified medical professional. It is a developmental condition caused by differences in the brain. There is not one type of autism, but many. No two autistic students are alike. There is no one known cause of autism but instead it is thought to develop from a combination of genetic influences and environmental influences. There are three diagnostic levels of autism  level 1 ( requiring support ), level 2 ( requiring substantial support ), and level 3 ( requiring very substantial support ). What is autism NOT  Autism is not a learning disability, though it can affect learning. Autism does not automatically equate to high IQ or superior mathematical or computational skills. It is not a behavior behavioral condition or mental health disorder. Autism does not cause behaviors that present as challenging to the teacher or the class. Behaviors are a method of communication. They can be a response to a biological cause, such as pain or discomfort, or due to a social or sensory cause. It is not a disease. Common characteristics and co-occurring conditions  Students with autism may be uncomfortable making eye contact, miss some social cues, feel overwhelmed in social situations and have focused interests. Anxiety is common for autistic students, but not all anxiety is the same. Neuroscientists have found structural differences in autistic people s amygdala, the brain s emotion and fear center, that suggest autism-related anxiety is different from general anxiety. While autistic people can present with both forms, management can be vastly different, and different from non-autistic anxiety management. Laws protecting students with autism  The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) specifies that children with various disabilities, including autism, are entitled to early intervention services and special education. The law requires schools to develop an Individualized Education Program (IEP) which provides for specialized instruction and related services to meet the student s unique educational needs. A student does not have to be placed in a separate classroom to be eligible for an IEP. IDEA requires that students are educated in the Least Restrictive Environment (LRE), with their non-disabled peers, with supplementary aids and services. Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 is the law that protects students with disabilities from discrimination in programs that receive federal funding, including public schools. The law requires that schools provide reasonable accommodations for children with disabilities so that they can fully participate in regular education classes and activities with their non-disabled peers. Accommodations are provided under a 504 plan, which is developed under the general education program.",

    "text": "Whether a student has an IEP or 504 Plan or not, a student with an autism diagnosis is protected by various anti-discrimination laws, like the American with Disabilities Act (ADA) and privacy laws. Of note, the decision to disclose a diagnosis is the right of the autistic student and their parents only. If a parent or autistic student shares their diagnosis to school administrators and teachers, it is to be treated as confidential. It is never acceptable to share a student s diagnosis with anyone, especially not a class or student s peers. Autism 102  Understanding your autistic student Review the class list for any student with an Individualized Education Plan (IEP) or 504 plan and read the documents thoroughly. Both are legally binding  adherence is required by law. If any accommodations within are unclear or unable to be implemented, notify school administration and parents. Neither parent nor teacher can revise these plans without a procedural review and subsequent documentation of changes. Recognize  accommodations are not privileges. They are rights. Learn more in our Guide to Individualized Education Programs, which is now available in an interactive format that allows for easy navigation to sections including  IEP Basics  and  Changing an IEP . Honor and respect the student s preferred way to identify with autism if they have disclosed their diagnosis to you, whether that be person-first (person with autism) or identity-first (autistic student). Honor and respect the student s preferred communication method. Some autistic students may switch their communication method depending on the setting. For instance, a student who can be verbal one-on-one with you may become selectively verbal or nonverbal in a group. Do not force communication outside of what is comfortable for them at any moment. If an issue arises out of this, refer to their IEP 504 or guidance counselor if without one. Presume competence. Autistic students in a general education classroom are general education students first, regardless of their supports. If an autistic student has special education support staff, work with them as a team. The student should be  our  student, not  your  or  my  student. Language matters and conveys a powerful message, especially when used in front of an autistic student and their peers. Seek out people who know them well, including family members and prior teaching staff, as early in the school year as possible. Completing the  About Me  profile worksheet in our School Community Tool Kit with parents is a good start. Anxiety is one of the most common co-occurring conditions with autism. Even without a diagnosis of anxiety, many with autism have anxiety in social situations, particularly with peers. Do not force socialization. If an issue arises out of this, refer to their IEP 504 or guidance counselor if without one. Discuss preferred seating in the classroom with parents and the autistic student. The student may have a different preferred location depending on which subject they are learning, which classroom they are in, and who their classmates are. Carefully consider pairings when group work is required. It is best to ask for input from family and past teachers. Do not assume an autistic student and an outgoing student are a good balance, or that an autistic student and an introverted student complement one another. Make sure the autistic student has an appropriate, equitable, defined task within the group. Be aware that free play, recess and other unstructured times are often the most difficult times for autistic students. They often have the desire to interact with others, but do not have the skills to engage appropriately or may be overwhelmed by the process. Look to see if autistic students are eating alone at lunch or wandering outside by themselves at recess. Think about how to provide structure to these students during that time to keep them engaged in school. Forming social groups around special interests or assigning tasks for teachers or school are good options. Immediately notify school administrators and parents if an issue arises with an autistic student. Do not first attempt to resolve a concerning issue alone. It is best to err on the side of oversharing with school administration and parents when issues arise. NOTE  If an autistic student is engaging in behavior that poses a risk to themselves or others at school, seek help immediately. Follow your school s crisis protocols. Never ignore the signs of a crisis situation. Always take threats of suicide or harm seriously.

    "text": "Sounds Excessive Noise  Allow for earplugs if a classroom is particularly noisy. Reconsider the use of whistles or buzzers to signify the start stop of an activity and instead use visual clues. Develop a signal with the student to let them know when a school bell will alarm. Lighting  Try dimming or turning off florescent or bright lights. Smells  Give enough advance warning if products with strong odors will be used in class. Allow the student to sit near an open window or fan that helps dissipate strong smells. Consider a school policy that limits the use of perfume, cologne and body sprays. Be predictable. Change can be more difficult for autistic students than for their peers, especially if it is unplanned. Make it a habit to go over the daily schedule at the start of class. Provide advance notice of any changes to the schedule, including if there will be a substitute teacher. Be flexible with participation in the classroom. Reconsider grading requirements that award or punish for traditional participation, like raising hand or speaking up in class. Consider using individual whiteboards or give out washable markers for everyone to write answers on their desk. This tool works to check-in and ensure students of all learning styles and abilities are engaged in class. If a presentation is a class requirement, consider providing the entire class with multiple options beyond public speaking. Consider multimedia alternatives and tools used by working professionals  PowerPoint, FlipGrid, Zoom, etc. Do not consider or communicate alternative forms of participation as a privilege or reserved only for autistic students. Facilitate positive social relationships within the classroom by teaching about inclusion. Use our School Community Tool Kit and refer to our tips for teaching peers about inclusion. It is highly recommended to inform all students and their parents ahead of any discussion on inclusion or disabilities. Do not ask autistic students to explain autism to you or the class. Even when parents disclose to the school, some autistic students still prefer not to disclose or discuss their diagnosis. Recognize that students with disabilities are more likely to be bullied. Be prepared to help prevent and correct troublesome situations with our 10 bullying facts. Recognize you may be unaware of every autistic student in your classroom. Some parents do not disclose their child s autism diagnosis. The decision is theirs. Their child is still protected by IDEA. Asking a student if they are autistic, openly speculating whether a student is autistic and openly assigning behavior challenging to you as autistic can all be considered violations of this law. If a student is struggling and you are concerned it is due to autism spectrum disorder but have not been made aware of a diagnosis, it is recommended that you document the struggles. Act on what you see, not what you suspect. Present findings free and clear of judgment to the parents and school administration.",

    "text": "Autism and middle school  Managing growth and change A mom and lifelong educator shares her autistic son s journey Back to school is a big deal for Lisa C., a career educator by trade and school advocate by right, as mom of Chase, her 12-year-old on the spectrum. Her husband is also an educator, and their younger son is only two grades behind Chase. School prep and planning in her house is a season that rivals the most wonderful time of the year. The eve of the first day back is always filled with anticipation. But this year, emotions are running particularly high. After 19 years of teaching in a general education classroom, Lisa is beginning her first year as an assistant principal in a new elementary school. More importantly, Chase is starting middle school and leaving his 10-year-old brother and the close-knit community he was part of for seven years. Here, Lisa shares Chase s journey through school, how they are preparing him for his new environment and how he has taught her as much about managing change as she has taught him. Preschool   Kindergarten Chase was 2.5 years old when he was diagnosed with autism. He received early intervention services all the way up to kindergarten through our school district s Intermediate Unit. Many of those services were play-based. We wanted him to explore and learn authentically. We advocated for him as educators. We saw things that stood out to us that were not typical, so we proactively pursued the district. We knew the outcome   the earlier we got him the support he needed, the better. When it came time to enroll him in kindergarten, I worried about everything. What didn t I worry about, is the real question. The district provided an evaluation so they could determine the most appropriate placement for him. He ended up in a self-contained class in the morning and participated in an autism support class. In the afternoon, he went into an inclusion class with supports including a special education teacher and an instructional assistant. Elementary School One big worry, which continues today, was that Chase would be misunderstood in school because of some involuntary and voluntary behaviors he has. I don t mean bad behaviors, but his mannerisms and how he reacts to things. Initially, I didn t worry about how kids would respond to him  I worried about how the adults would. When he becomes overwhelmed, he exhibits behavior that some may notice and may cause them to think he s a bad boy or weird or wonder why he does that. We worried he wouldn t be seen for his strengths and kindness and things that make him so lovable. A lot of physical growth happens in seven years at an elementary school. We monitored his changing body and how that impacted how he responded in a classroom. We had to do a lot of advocating to get him the proper supports so he could be the best Chase. For example, he requires a lot of input for his sensory system. When he got older and was required to sit for longer periods of time, we advocated for him to have movement and sensory breaks so he could then concentrate during academic instruction. Chase has always had friends. Everyone loves Chase. He s fun and social and loves to be around people. But he is also an easy target. There have been times when other students have encouraged him to do things they know he shouldn t do, because they know he will do them. One time during lunch, a bunch of boys were talking about blowing things up. This was on the heels of a school assembly around reporting threats. The boys knew the boundaries of the conversation. Chase did not. They encouraged him to continue with the discussion and then reported him for unsafe behavior. I have had phone calls from the principal, and they were understanding because they know the circumstances. But I was not always happy with how the students who egged him on were treated. These situations can be powerful teachable moments if handled properly. My advice to schools is to always use them as such. Regardless of how school handled these situations, we always gave Chase a consequence at home, like taking away screen time, to understand that what he did was an unexpected behavior. One of his therapists taught us that years ago. Instead of saying his behavior was  bad  or  inappropriate,  we were encouraged to use  unexpected  and explain to Chase that what he did was not the expectation. We are not trying to normalize him or force him to assimilate. We just want to help him use his unique skills and mindset to make good decisions. Middle School Now, going into middle school where he will combine with new kids from three other schools, I worry he will be misunderstood by his peers. The things that still interest him don t necessarily interest other kids his age anymore. Sometimes he has a hard time connecting because he doesn t always recognize social cues or what is age-appropriate with his friends.",

    "text": "I can t help but worry that he won t develop positive relationships that will transcend his years in school. At home we have been practicing scenarios and conversations that could come up, and we hope that will help him in real time. The shift from summer to school is hard enough with getting back to a routine. As a family, two weeks prior to the start of school we switch back to a school night bed routine. We have found this is as important for the teachers in the house as it is for the students. But now Chase is in a new building and has to change classes. We have done tours and we found out he has some friends in some of his classes which helps. But since first grade Chase has been fully included in general education with support of either a special education teacher or an instructional assistant with him throughout the day. For the last three years he had the same assistant which had a huge impact on his life and helped him grow. This year though, instead of having that one-on-one, he will share a support person with one or two other students, which means he s going to have to become more independent. It is definitely the right direction for him. Putting on my teacher hat, our goal is for all kids with special needs is to reduce if not eliminate supports. General education teachers are supposed to strive to support all students in our setting. We want students with supports to master their goals and be fully included. Making it so that a student can shift from one-on-one support to shared support is part of our job. And helping a student accomplish that speaks to the magic that a teacher can have on a student s life. Putting back on my mom hat though, anticipating all that goes along with increased independence is worrisome. Executive functioning is not one of his strengths. I think it will be difficult for him to manage organizationally. So we will have to monitor closely and find what works for him. The physical act of writing is tough for Chase, physically and mentally. His fine motor skills are weak. His ideas are there but left to handwrite, the output does not match his true ability. One of his accommodations has been to use assistive technology. He would mostly word process and only use handwriting in math. The good thing in his new school is that every student gets their own laptop, so everyone has his accommodation. It is a good example of universal design. Every student now has access to a tool that is useful for all learning styles and needs. There are a lot of little things that will be firsts for Chase now too that we are trying to anticipate. For instance, he is going to have a locker with a combination lock. So we bought him a lock and he has been practicing at home. We told him if he gets good enough, he can help others who may have trouble with theirs. We want to instill in him that he can be a leader. Along with that, something we do a lot with Chase at home is talk about what could happen, what are the possibilities. We are trying to prepare him for likely situations so in the event of one, he can respond in the moment. While we have been doing all this planning with and for him, the beautiful thing about Chase is that he takes each day as it comes. In the moment things can overwhelm him. But he does not look too far in advance. He lives for the day. That has been incredibly helpful as I have been trying to navigate both of us making big school adjustments. The best part of all of this is I have recognized that Chase has taught me as much about managing change as I have taught him.",

    "text": "Expert Q A  Dr. Ryan Adams shares tips and resources to end bullying By Marta Chmielowicz Children and adolescents with autism are particularly vulnerable to bullying but preventing and stopping it when it happens can be a challenge. In response to this need, Dr. Ryan Adams, Ph.D., has pursued a decade-long career in research on autism and bullying and developed a web-based program that offers information and strategies to parents, teachers, peers and victims of bullying. In this Q A, Dr. Adams discusses some of his key research findings and shares his bullying prevention guides for teens, parents and teachers. Dr. Adams is a developmental psychologist in the UC Department of Pediatrics at Cincinnati Children s Hospital Medical Center, a member site of the Autism Speaks-supported Autism Care Network. His research focuses on adolescents, peer victimization, bullying and depressive symptoms. What does research tell us about bullying and autism  When you look at the research, what s interesting is the results are pretty consistent in terms of autism and bullying during adolescence. There are two big trends I see in the research. First, individuals with autism, even compared to individuals with other developmental disorders, experience higher rates of bullying and at a more frequent pace. In my research with Dr. Somer Bishop and Dr. Julie Lounds Taylor, we found that 46  of individuals with autism were experiencing at least one form of peer victimization at least once a week and 35  were experiencing it every day. This is very high, especially when we compare it to the general population where typically 2-3  experience bullying once a week and 1-2  every day. Second, studies have shown that bullying is associated with several negative outcomes, including internalizing problems, anxiety, depression, suicide and other health issues. In our research, we also found that it s related to poor performance at school, lower feelings of safety at school and feelings of not fitting in. These associations are nearly twice as strong in individuals with autism than the general population. Perhaps surprisingly, verbal bullying had the strongest association with these outcomes. Why are autistic people at highest risk of being bullied  Especially during adolescence, children are looking for people to conform, and adolescents with autism sometimes don t conform to a typical script. The mere fact that they might behave differently is enough to put them at risk. What is your approach to bullying prevention in your Guides to End Bullying  We know a lot about how to address bullying, but I noticed it wasn t getting into the hands of parents, teachers, peers and the individuals being victimized. Typically, comprehensive bullying interventions are implemented in schools, but individual families can t access that and the resources available to families are very limited or simplistic. What we tried to do is take a wide range of ideas and strategies and put them into a place where teens and families could easily access them. What came out of that is the Girls Guide to End Bullying and the Boys Guide to End Bullying. These are web-based programs aimed towards teens to help them recognize when bullying is happening and develop their own strategies for dealing with and preventing bullying. Each guide is divided by type of bullying (for example, verbal, physical, relational, etc.). They are then further divided into five sections, with real-life examples in each section  Recognizing bullying The consequences of bullying What to do and not do when you see bullying happen What to do and not do when bullying is happening to you Highlights and things to think about We also offer a parent manual that guides parents through difficult conversations with their children and the school, as well as a teacher manual and lesson plans. What are some examples of strategies you offer in the guides  We know the most effective way to stop bullying is giving the larger group of bystanders the tools they need to recognize when it s happening and get involved. A lot of times, people get away with bullying by saying they were kidding, so we teach kids that doesn t matter. Then, we give them different strategies to support the person being bullied. For example, the easiest thing to do if you witness bullying in school is not to laugh. Normally, the bully is only doing these things to gain social status, so not laughing takes away that reinforcement. For people who are victims of bullying, the most important thing is not to overreact. That s a hard thing to do, especially for someone with autism, so we give them different strategies to help them. For example, we might recommend that they leave the situation or write down what they will say to the bully ahead of time. We also give them ideas of how to respond and redirect the bully.",

    "text": "Expert Q A  How ABA therapy can help with severe behaviors By Marta Chmielowicz Some people diagnosed with autism struggle with severe and distressing behaviors that can be destructive, harmful to the individual and others. This can impact their participation in learning and community life. These behaviors can range in intensity, but include things like aggression, self-injurious behaviors, elopement (running away) and pica (eating things that aren t food), among others. Applied Behavior Analysis (ABA) therapy is an evidence-based intervention that can help people with autism learn healthier behaviors and improve their quality of life. The goal of ABA is to work with the person to build skills that allow them to communicate their needs in healthier ways, reducing harmful or dangerous behaviors. In this Q A, Karryn Naranjo, M.A, BCBA, shares information about how ABA therapy can help reduce severe behaviors. Born in Pereira, Colombia, Karryn has created and implemented behavior programs for children with autism and other developmental disorders in different settings  school, home and in the clinic. She is now the Behavior Intervention Division lead at the The Center for Autism and Neurodevelopmental Disorders at University of California, Irvine, a member site of the Autism Speaks-supported Autism Care Network. How can ABA help autistic people experiencing severe behaviors  What are some of the strategies you might use  One of the biggest benefits of ABA is that the therapy is very individualized, and every strategy is chosen based on the environment and the child s needs. Typically, we begin by assessing the child s behavior, because there are many kinds of severe behaviors that might put their safety at risk. After we identify the harmful behavior, we create what we call an operational definition. We are very specific in defining what the target behavior is, what it looks like and what it doesn t look like. This helps us follow guidance and track the correct data to monitor progress. All behavior has a function, or a reason why it s happening, so we conduct a functional behavior assessment (FBA) to understand what is causing the behavior. We look at what happens before and after the behavior to identify the reasons behind the behavior. Sometimes, behaviors have more than one function. Then, depending on the behavior and its severity, intensity and frequency, we look for strategies to reduce that behavior. For example, let s say a child is being aggressive towards others. When we conduct the FBA, we identify that the function of the behavior is a need for attention the child is aggressive because they do not know how to communicate that they need someone to interact with them. We then come up with a plan to teach the child skills to communicate the need behind the behavior. For example, we might teach them how to tap someone s shoulder or say their name to get their attention. In that way, the child will reduce the aggressive behaviors and increase the skills that will improve their interactions with their peers and the people in their community. How do you teach a child healthier skills and behaviors  It depends on the child s skills and learning style. If the child learns well by repetition, we use that in some cases. If the child doesn t have great motor skills, we might use hand-over-hand guidance. If the child is nonverbal, we might use visual supports. If the child is very advanced, we might use role play. We might also use verbal directions, gestures or other prompts. Throughout this process, we collect data to monitor progress on our goals. This might be data about the frequency or duration of a behavior. We might also collect latency data, or information about the time frame between when a person gives an instruction and the child follows through. We often ask parents to collect this information for us because they know better than anyone how often the behavior occurs. At the end of the day, parents are the ones who need to learn the intervention strategies and follow through at home to make sure there is consistency in treatment and the child can learn and generalize their new skills. Can you share a case study where ABA helped a family cope with a difficult behavioral situation  R. is a 10-year-old who presented aggressive behaviors (kicking, slapping and punching others) when he wanted to use his iPad. One of the biggest issues for his mom was around bedtime. R. refused to stop using his iPad, and most nights, he engaged in tantrums with physical contact towards his mom to keep watching his screen. Mom tried different approaches to limit R. s access to his iPad, but this caused a very tense situation at home because mom was  afraid and tired  of R. s reactions. From an ABA perspective, it was important to collect data on these scenarios to identify the function, or the reason for the behavior. In this case, it was clear that the function of the aggressive behavior was accessing the iPad.",

    "text": "It was critical to then identify strategies to decrease the aggressive behavior. R. was prompted to ask verbally ( May I use the iPad  ) without engaging in physical contact with mom. Mom was guided to give access to the iPad only when this sentence was expressed in the absence of aggressive behaviors. Different strategies to help mom limit access to the iPad were also used, such as a timer (to indicate the end of iPad time) and the use of a visual schedule with an afternoon nighttime routine. Mom was guided to provide alternatives (different screens) when denying access to the iPad. Lastly, special instructions were provided for mom to successfully follow through when saying that the total iPad time for the day was reached. After a few months, R. was able to understand that there were some limits to his access to the iPad, that there was a routine to follow in the afternoon and nighttime, and that aggressive behaviors wouldn t give him access to the iPad, but requesting the iPad verbally without any aggression would give him access. How can parents find an effective ABA practitioner  First, find out if your insurance covers ABA and how much it covers. Then, start looking at different agencies that work with your insurance company. Paying out of pocket for this service can be very costly. Find a provider that fits your family and child s schedule. Keep in mind of the long waitlist and reach out to a few organizations. I also encourage to learn about ABA, the research behind it and how to maximize this service for your child and family. I suggest looking for a therapist who is really tuned into the needs of the child. You want someone who can adapt their strategies depending on the child s needs and interests, and who looks to understand the child s motivations. That will help them approach the goal with the right reinforcer. For example, if a child likes batteries or trains, integrating that into the therapy can be very effective. It s also important to look for a therapist who has experience with your child s specific behaviors. Some questions to ask are  Does the therapist have knowledge about this specific matter  How are they going to be supervised  How are we going to follow through with their strategies  What data are they collecting throughout the treatment process",

    "text": "Expert Q A  Supporting siblings of autistic children with aggressive behaviors Every sibling relationship has its ups and downs, and this is no different for siblings of autistic children. Having a sibling with autism brings many joys, but when an autistic sibling exhibits aggression or other severe behaviors, it can be especially challenging for the other child and have long term effects if unaddressed. It s important for parents and caregivers to know how to support their children through these challenges by acknowledging their feelings, keeping lines of communication open and teaching healthy coping strategies. Support groups can be a valuable tool, giving both siblings and parents a safe space to share their experiences and learn new skills. In this Q A, sibling researcher Emily Rubin, LICSW, shares information about siblings experiencing aggression from autistic brothers and sisters. Emily is director of sibling support at the Eunice Kennedy Shriver Center at UMass Chan Medical School, and she developed a free virtual program to support siblings and caregivers. To join the program or learn more, please contact Emily at emily.rubin umassmed.edu or (857) 523-1145. How do aggression and other severe behaviors impact siblings of children with autism and other developmental disorders  Research tells us that in general, there s no significant difference in developmental outcomes between siblings of typically developing children and the majority of siblings that have brothers or sisters with disabilities. But it s a different picture when you re dealing with siblings of children with severe behavioral challenges, because once aggression or violence enters the picture, it can create trauma. It can be very isolating if you are growing up with a brother or sister who is aggressive or destructive and lashing out at you, whether they are autistic or not. It can start to feel like your world isn t safe, you re alone and people don t understand what you re going through. When siblings are targets of physical or verbal aggression by a brother or sister, they tend to experience resentment and anger. There is also a pervasive sense of confusion, because it doesn t make sense to the sibling why their parents are treating them one way and the brother or sister in another way. There can be shame or embarrassment, and these siblings might not want to invite friends over. The more intense the behavioral challenges, the more intense these factors become. Another pattern I ve observed is that siblings of children with behavioral challenges don t want to burden their parents. They keep their personal worries to themselves, and as a result, they often end up not having many connections with adults who they can process things with. Many siblings struggle with anxiety and depression because they re dealing with trauma on their own and carrying difficult emotional baggage at a young age. In adulthood, this might lead to them cutting off contact with their sibling because they feel abused and victimized. However, this can be mitigated if there are interventions and supports for the whole family. What work are you doing to address these issues  Right now, I have two programs underway. The Sibling Support Program  A Family-Centered Mental Health Initiative is a community-based program offered by UMass Chan Medical School. This is a free, virtual, monthly program for siblings and caregivers of children with behavioral health needs. We welcome family members of children with many different diagnoses, ranging from autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to early onset schizophrenia. The program is available at the national level, not only for Massachusetts residents. The other is a research study looking at the impact of our sibling support program on siblings of children with ASD compared to siblings of children with other disabilities. We re looking at whether the support program can minimize the impact of trauma by providing a safe space for siblings to share their stories and teaching coping skills. What makes your sibling support program unique  Our program is unique primarily because we provide support and resources for all family members of the affected child, not just the siblings. The Sibling Support Program  A Family-Centered Mental Health Initiative consists of virtual groups for caregivers and siblings held simultaneously. Our sibling groups are led by psychiatry residents and trainees at UMass Chan Medical School. Our clinicians create a welcoming space for siblings to share their stories, process their trauma, learn coping skills and understand that they re not alone that there are caring adults who understand the stressors of growing up with a brother or sister who has behavioral needs. Not only are we delivering a service for families, but we re also training clinicians in how to work in a very holistic, family-centered way with families of people with autism and other diagnoses.",

    "text": "We also have groups specifically for parents and caregivers so that siblings and parents have separate safe spaces. The caregiver groups are not run by a clinician but by a parent mentor who has similar lived experiences. The caregiver groups focus on the sibling experience, parenting strategies that help build sibling resiliency and mitigate the effects of trauma, and resource sharing to strengthen the family unit. Our goal is to work with the whole family to help them understand the impact on the sibling and help them develop new skills and new language to talk about what s happening at home. The reason we meet with siblings and caregivers separately is that we don t want the siblings to feel inhibited when sharing their experience. And the same is true for the parents they benefit from a private Zoom group where they don t have to censor themselves or worry they might say something that the sibling could misinterpret. This arrangement helps siblings feel validated and understood, while allowing parents and caregivers the opportunity to learn alongside non-judgmental peers. How can families sign up  Families interested in the Sibling Support Program  A Family-Centered Mental Health Initiative can contact me directly at emily.rubin umassmed.edu or (857) 523-1145. They will receive information about the program, a permission form and Zoom link to log in. What tips would you give to parents looking to support their typically developing children through some of these challenges  My first tip is to talk openly and honestly with the sibling about the behavioral issues. Children should never have to keep secrets about scary things happening at home   that leads to more problems. It s also important to use age-appropriate language. In general, the younger a child is, the simpler you want your explanations to be. Another tip is to help kids to have their own lives and identities outside of their identity as a sibling. Every child needs to feel like they re good at something, and every child should have opportunities to shine, whether that s through their own hobbies, sports, or other activities. They should also have breathing room and personal space where they can go when things get chaotic. Lastly, if there is more than one parent in the household, using multiple modes of transportation such as a car and public transportation to do family activities is helpful. That way, if the child with autism has a meltdown or is overstimulated, the sibling can still participate in the activity. Because that s where a lot of resentment comes in when siblings  opportunities to do things are interrupted because their brother or sister has a meltdown.",

    "text": "Individualized Education Programs (IEPs) What s an IEP  Students who need extra help and support in school may be eligible for special education services in the form of an individualized education program (IEP). This program is offered free of charge to families of kids in public schools and outlines the goals and any support services that may be needed for a child to succeed in school. The Individuals with Disabilities Education Act (IDEA) says that parents and guardians of students with disabilities or special health care needs are important members of their child s education team. They should work with educators to develop a plan that helps kids succeed in school. Understanding how to get and use these services will help your child be as successful as possible in school. Who Needs an IEP  Students who are eligible for special education services need an IEP. While there are many reasons that students could be eligible, some common conditions include  attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) autism cognitive challenges developmental delays emotional disorders hearing problems learning problems physical disabilities speech or language impairment vision problems How Are Services Offered  In most cases, the services and goals outlined in an IEP can be offered in a general school environment. This can be done in the regular classroom (for example, a reading teacher helps a small group of children who need extra help while the other kids in the class work with the regular teacher.) The small group serves students with similar needs who are brought together for help. Every effort is made to help kids learn alongside their peers who do not have disabilities. But sometimes the level of support needed can t be met in a general classroom, so students are educated in a specialized learning classroom that is more appropriate for their needs. These classes have fewer students per teacher and allow for more one-on-one instruction. The teacher usually has training in helping kids with special educational needs. Students spend most of their day in a small group classroom and join the regular classes whenever possible   for example lunch, gym, or the arts. What s the Referral and Evaluation Process  The referral process begins when a teacher, parent, or doctor is concerned that a child may be having trouble in the classroom, and the teacher notifies the school counselor or psychologist. The first step is to gather specific information about the student s progress or academic problems. This may be done through  a conference with parents a conference with the student watching the student in class to assess performance (attention, behavior, work completion, tests, classwork, homework, etc.) This information helps school officials decide the best next step. Sometimes new classroom strategies are all that s needed to help a child become more successful. If this doesn t work, the child will get an educational assessment, which can find a specific learning disability or other health impairment. Note  The presence of a disability doesn t automatically guarantee a child will get services. To be eligible, the disability must affect how the child does at school. To decide on a child s eligibility, a team of professionals will consider their observations, as well as how the child does on standardized tests and daily work such as tests, quizzes, classwork, and homework. Who s On the Team  As a guardian, you can decide whether to have your child assessed. If you choose to do so, you ll be asked to sign a permission form that will detail who is involved in the process and the types of tests they use. These tests might include measures of specific school skills, such as reading and math or developmental skills, like speech and language. The professionals on the evaluation team can include  classroom teachers a psychologist a physical therapist an occupational therapist a speech therapist a special needs educator a vision or hearing specialist others, depending on the child s specific needs When the team finishes the assessment, a comprehensive evaluation report is developed. This report includes an educational classification and outlines the skills and support the child will need. You can review this report before an IEP is developed. If there is something that you don t agree with, work together with the team to come up with a plan that best meets your child s needs. How Is an IEP Developed  The next step is an IEP meeting with you and the team to decide what will go into the IEP. A regular teacher should also attend this meeting to offer suggestions for how the plan can help your child progress through the standard education curriculum. At the meeting, the team will discuss your child s educational needs   as described in the evaluation report   and develop specific, measurable short-term and yearly goals for each of those needs.",

    "text": "You can take an active role in developing the goals and determining which skills or areas will receive the most attention. The cover page of the IEP outlines the support services your child will get and how often they will be provided (for example, occupational therapy twice a week). Support services might include  special education speech therapy occupational or physical therapy counseling medical services like nursing or vision and hearing therapy Services might also include transportation, test help or modifications, participation in special programs, and the inclusion of transition planning beginning at age 14. If the team recommends several services, the amount of time they take in the child s school schedule can seem overwhelming. To ease that load, a professional may talk with your child s teacher to come up with strategies that help but won t offer hands-on instruction. For example, an occupational therapist may suggest accommodations for a child with fine-motor problems that affect handwriting, and the classroom teacher would incorporate these suggestions into the handwriting lessons taught to the entire class. Other services can be delivered right in the classroom, so the child s day isn t interrupted by therapy. The child who has trouble with handwriting might work one-on-one with an occupational therapist while everyone else practices their handwriting skills. When deciding how and where services are offered, the child s comfort and dignity should be a top priority. Your child s IEP should be reviewed annually to update goals and make sure your child is getting the support that s needed. However, IEPs can be changed at any time on an as-needed basis. If you think your child needs more, fewer, or different services, you can request a meeting and bring the team together to discuss your concerns. What Are My Legal Rights  Guidelines (sometimes called procedural safeguards) outline your rights as a parent to control what happens to your child throughout the IEP process. For example, timelines ensure that the development of an IEP moves from referral to providing services as quickly as possible. When your child is referred, ask about this timeline and get a copy of your parents  rights. The parents  rights also describe how you can proceed if you disagree with any part of the evaluation report or the IEP   mediation and hearings are some options. You can get information about low-cost or free legal representation from the school district or through early intervention programs. Attorneys and paid advocates familiar with the IEP process will provide representation if you need it. You also may invite anyone who knows or works with your child whose input you feel would be helpful to join the IEP team. Federally supported programs in each state support parent-to-parent information and training activities for parents of children with special needs. The Parent Training and Information Projects conduct workshops, publish newsletters, and answer questions by phone or by mail about parent-to-parent activities. What Else Should I Know  Parents have the right to choose where their kids will be educated. This choice includes public or private elementary schools and secondary schools, including religious schools. It also includes charter schools and home schools. But parents should know that the rights of children with disabilities who are placed in private elementary schools and secondary schools are not the same as children with disabilities who are enrolled in public schools. Two major differences that parents, teachers, school staff, private school representatives, and kids need to know about are  Children with disabilities who are placed by their parents in private schools may not get the same services they would get in a public school. Not all kids with disabilities placed by their parents in private schools will get services. The IEP process is complex, but it s also an effective way to address how your child learns. If you have concerns, be sure to ask about the evaluation findings or the goals recommended by your child s IEP team. You know your child best and should play a central role in creating a learning plan tailored to their specific needs. Medically reviewed by  Colleen O Shea, M.Ed Date reviewed  March 2022",

To propose and define a common terminology for describing levels of spoken language ability in the expressive modality and set benchmarks for determining a child s language level in order to establish a framework for comparing outcomes across intervention studies. Method  The NIDCD assembled a group of researchers with interests and experience in the study of language development and disorders in young children with ASD. The group worked for 18 months through a series of conference calls and correspondence, culminating in a meeting held in December 2007 to achieve consensus on these aims. Results  We recommend moving away from using the term  functional speech,  replacing it with a developmental framework  We recommend multiple sources of information to define language phases, including natural language samples, parent report, and standardized measures  We provide guidelines and objective criteria for defining children s spoken language expression in three major phases that correspond to developmental levels between 8 and 48 months of age. Introduction Autism is a neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by primary impairments in social interactions, communication, and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors (American Psychiatric Association, 2000). In addition, autism often results in significant disability, including intellectual deficits, language and adaptive behavior deficits, as well as problem behaviors. It is now recognized that classic autism is part of a spectrum of related disorders that includes pervasive developmental disorder-not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS) and Asperger syndrome  this set of diagnoses, collectively, is referred to here as autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Outcomes for children with ASD represent a broad continuum, with only a small percentage achieving independence and full employment as adults (Howlin, Goode, Hutton,   Rutter, 2004). ASDs are no longer thought to be rare disorders. Current reports indicate that 1 in every 150 children in the United States will receive an ASD diagnosis (Bertrand, Mars, Byle, Bove, 2001  Kuehn, 2007  Yeargin-Allsopp, Rice, Karapurka, Doernberg, Boyle, Murphy, 2003). Children with ASD have long been known to respond to interventions that target specific skills and behaviors (NRC, 2001), and numerous studies have demonstrated the positive effects of early intervention on language development for the majority of children with ASD (Dawson   Osterling, 1997  Koegel   Koegel, 1988  Lovaas, 1987  Rogers, 2005  Rogers   Vismara, 2008), with some, though sparse, evidence of long lasting benefit. The fact that language development can be positively affected by early treatment has tremendous potential significance, because the emergence of spoken language is one of the most important variables predicting better outcomes in later childhood and adulthood (Gillberg   Steffenburg, 1987  Howlin et al., 2004  Venter, Lord,   Schopler, 1992). Thus, given the role of language acquisition in shaping long term outcomes, it has become important to identify the most successful strategies for facilitating language acquisition in young children with ASD, who uniformly demonstrate significant delays in at least some aspects of language and communicative development, especially in the domain of pragmatics (Tager-Flusberg, Paul   Lord, 2005). While various intervention approaches teach and measure language acquisition in different ways, depending on the philosophy and underlying theory of the approach (see Rogers 2005 for a review), consumers of this literature must be able to compare language outcomes from different treatment approaches. Despite the numerous published language outcome studies of early intervention in ASD (Rogers, 2005), it is not possible to compare language outcomes across reports, because of the lack of uniform measurement approaches to assessing language skills, and the lack of uniform terminology for describing language outcomes in ASD. Many intervention programs for children with ASD, aim to facilitate the development of  functional speech.",

    "text": "However, because there has never been consensus on the definition of  functional speech  it is impossible to compare the longer term efficacy of different treatment programs. In this paper we offer an alternative framework for describing spoken language acquisition in children with ASD. The proposal described here replaces the arbitrary singular categorical distinction encompassed by the terminology of  functional speech  with a framework that captures the continuous developmental processes that underlie language acquisition. Goals In December 2006 the NIDCD assembled a group of experts in language disorders and language acquisition in young children with ASD to address these issues. Over the next year the group worked together through a series of conference calls and correspondence, culminating in a meeting held in December 2007. This paper summarizes the group s recommendations relating to our primary goal of providing benchmarks for defining the acquisition of spoken language in the expressive modality in young children with ASD. The working group set two major objectives  To develop a set of recommended measures that can be used for evaluating the efficacy of interventions that target spoken language acquisition as part of treatment research studies or for use in applied settings. To propose and define a common terminology for describing levels of spoken language ability and set benchmarks for determining a child s spoken language level in order to establish a framework for comparing outcomes across intervention studies. As such, this paper is addressed primarily to researchers  however, practitioners and other consumers are also relevant audiences. For researchers in early autism intervention, who may come from a wide range of theoretical backgrounds and practices, our goal is to provide common terminology and a suggested approach to defining language abilities before, during, and after treatment. The varying measurement approaches used in language intervention research require different levels of financial and human resources and expertise. In addition, researchers have differing aims and hypotheses that may require specialized descriptions of language acquisition of their participants. Thus, we propose a measurement approach that may be applied in a  bare bones  fashion (e.g., relying on direct assessments and parent reports), as well as a more elaborated measurement system (e.g., adding in measures derived from natural language samples), covering the full range of language domains that could be included in treatment programs. By proposing these guidelines we hope to move beyond the ambiguously defined treatment goal of  functional speech  to a more standardized approach, using common measures and common definitions that will allow comparison of outcomes across studies. For practitioners, the proposed measures and benchmarks presented here provide a framework for describing the language progress of their clients during treatment. By providing a common framework we hope to facilitate the assessment process for clinicians, allowing them to measure their clients  language gains in relation to the research literature. Thus, we aim to enhance the relationship between treatment research and clinical practice in the field of language intervention in ASD. Our final target group of readers includes parents, early intervention professionals, and others who work to extract evidence of progress, whether research effectiveness or clinical efficacy, from clinical reports and research papers that use language measures to chart change in children with ASD. Clearly defined benchmarks of speech and language development will aid families, early childhood educators, and others who turn to the language research literature to understand language growth in young children with ASD. Some additional comments are in order. First, we focus here exclusively on the development of spoken language through the preschool years, omitting consideration of measures and benchmarks for defining preverbal communicative skills. While the working group recognizes that sophisticated language skills take many forms, including both verbal and non-verbal means for effective communication, and that children with ASD continue to make important advances in language well into the school years, we selected these constraints because outcome studies are uniform in the predictive power of spoken language (i.e., speaking in sentences that serve a variety of functions  e.g., Paul   Cohen, 1984) by age five for individuals with ASD (e.g., Howlin et al., 2004  Venter et al., 1992). Second, we limited our focus to the development of expressive language skills in children with ASD because most intervention studies target expressive language as the primary outcome and also because expressive language is more reliably assessed, especially in children with ASD (cf. Tager-Flusberg, 2000).",

    "text": "Third, we have limited our recommendations for measures and benchmarks to English, in part because almost all current studies have focused on English-speaking children with ASD. We hope, however, that the overall framework and guidelines presented here can be readily translated into other languages with some modifications. Recommendations for Measuring Expressive Language In order to capture the spoken language and communicative abilities of young children with ASD and to avoid sampling effects, assessments in this domain should include measures derived from multiple sources. These sources should ideally include (1) natural language samples, (2) parent report, and (3) direct standardized assessment. a) Natural Language Sample (NLS) Natural language samples that are collected in different communicative contexts provide excellent measures of a child s expressive language abilities, including phonological repertoire, lexical and grammatical knowledge, and pragmatic communicative skills  the latter are especially difficult to measure using other types of assessment. A NLS may be collected during either experimenter clinician-child or mother-child interactions. Contexts during which a NLS may be collected include the administration of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS  Lord et al., 2000), the Communication and Symbolic Behavior Scales (CSBS  Wetherby   Prizant, 2002), the Early Social and Communication Scales (ESCS  Mundy et al. 1996  Siebert et al., 1982), or equivalent contexts that include social communicative presses. The specific context should be determined based on the goals of the assessment. For example, if a primary outcome measure of a treatment program includes the functional use of specifically targeted forms, then adequate sampling of a range of different communicative contexts (e.g., contexts for requesting, protesting, sharing) would be needed. Typically, natural language samples will be at least 30 minutes in length to provide adequate time and opportunity to sample a sufficient number and range of utterances. For children with ASD, one may need to concatenate several short language samples to obtain 30 minutes of language behavior. Following the collection of a NLS (see Miller   Chapman, 2000 for discussion of methods), the data must be transcribed and coded to derive useful measures of the child s language. The particular level of transcription (e.g., phonetic, lexical, inclusion of adult language) will again depend on the specific focus of the assessment. Transcription and analyses can be supported by computer-based software, including the widely used Systematic Analysis of Language Transcripts (SALT  Miller   Chapman, 2008), Child Language Data Exchange System (CHILDES  MacWhinney, 2000), Lingquest (Mordecai   Palin, 1982), or Computerized Profiling (Long   Fey, 2004). b) Parent Report Parent report measures, administered in questionnaire or interview format, can provide useful information about a child s language skills that may not be observed in a laboratory or clinic setting. The most widely used measure is the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventory (MCDI  Fenson et al., 1993  2007). The MCDI can be used to assess children s expressive vocabulary and grammatical knowledge between the ages of 8 and 42 months. Although there are concerns that some parents may over- or under-report their child s language repertoire, parent report instruments have generally been shown to provide valid assessments of young children s language as measured by evidence that early predictors of language also predict MCDI productive raw scores in children with ASD (Charman, Baron-Cohen, Swettenham, Baird, Drew,   Cox, 2003  Luyster, Qui, Lopez   Lord, 2007). There is also evidence that MDCI scores are highly correlated with other measures of language in children with autism (Luyster, Kadlec, Connolly, Carter   Tager-Flusberg, 2008). c) Direct Assessment Standardized Tests Direct assessment of a child s language skills should be accomplished using standardized tests that have good psychometric properties, with particular attention paid to the reliability and validity of the measures that are derived from such tests for children with ASD. Standardized tests can be used to assess expressive language skills in phonological, lexical, grammatical and pragmatic domains of language. We note, however, that few standardized assessment instruments provide opportunities for assessing language skills aside from basic naming ability in children younger than 24 months of age. In addition, most elicited production tests have very few items during this early language period, which means that age equivalency or standard scores can change dramatically with a difference of only one or two raw score points. Imitation Echolalia Many children in the process of acquiring language use imitation and repetition of spoken language, especially during the early stages, to serve some functional communicative goals.",

    "text": "Echolalia and stereotyped language, consisting of scripts heard in previous contexts repeated in a non-communicative way, are atypical imitation behaviors that are part of the symptom pattern of ASDs (Kanner, 1946  Prizant, 1983). During the early stages of language acquisition, it may be difficult to discriminate typical from atypical verbal repetition in young children, and there are no clear criteria for defining delayed echolalia (Prizant   Duchan, 1981). Nevertheless, when characterizing the complexity of children s language, we recommend that echolalic (and imitative) language should be omitted from analyses, and from speech samples used to classify children according to the benchmarks described below. Framework for Describing Spoken Language Acquisition in ASD We take as our starting point a developmental approach in which we benchmark criteria for the acquisition of spoken language, and recommend measures for expressive language at different development levels. For each level we provide approximate age ranges, though these should be viewed as overlapping and not necessarily definitive. A developmental perspective provides a conceptual framework to guide intervention and evaluation of children with ASD, ensuring that researchers and clinicians strategically plan to target key language milestones within language intervention programs for children with ASD. Within a developmental framework, we identify 5 key phases of expressive language acquisition  Preverbal Communication. Children in this phase communicate using preverbal intentional communication through vocal (babble) and gestural means. This phase generally covers the age range of 6 to 12 months in typically developing children. As noted earlier, we have not included measures or benchmarks for this developmental phase as it is outside the scope of our goals. First Words. Children in this phase use non-imitated spontaneous single words referentially and symbolically to communicate about objects and events, including those outside the immediate context. At least some of their speech is intelligible and incorporates the most frequent consonant sounds heard in typical babble (Oller, 2000  Stoel-Gammon, 1998). Children in this phase use speech with a variety of people in different settings to serve several functions, including, but not limited to, labeling, requesting, and commenting on (directing joint attention) some objects or activities. This phase generally covers the age range of 12 to 18 months in typically developing children. Word Combinations. Children in this phase have a vocabulary that is rapidly increasing in size and includes a variety of parts of speech (nouns, verbs, descriptors). They are able to combine words creatively to refer to objects and events. Two- and three-word combinations are used for several different communicative functions. This phase generally covers the age range of 18 to 30 months in typically developing children. Sentences. Children in this phase combine words into clausal structures, or sentences, and use some morphological markers such as plurals, prepositions, and some verb endings. Their vocabulary is sufficiently large to serve their communicative needs in everyday situations. They communicate a wide range of functions in different settings with both familiar and unfamiliar people. The portion of this phase relevant for the proposed benchmarks defined here corresponds to typically developing children between the ages of 30 to 48 months. Complex Language. By the end of the preschool years, typically developing children have large and rich vocabularies that they use to communicate a wide range of topics (including abstract or hypothetical ideas) using complex grammatical constructions (e.g., relative clauses, sentential complements, anaphora) in different discourse contexts (e.g., conversation, narrative). We do not include either measures or benchmarks for this developmental phase (excluding measures not designed for children below the age of 48 months) as our focus is primarily on younger children with ASD. (For further reading, see Hoff   Shatz, 2007  Menn   Bernstein Ratner, 2000). Language Benchmarks Table 1 provides a summary of our proposed benchmarks that define the key developmental phases for spoken language expression (First Words, Word Combinations  Sentences) across the different domains of language, with examples of how each type of measure can be used to assess children s level of language use. As noted earlier, our objective in presenting this framework of benchmarks in each language domain at different developmental phases is explicitly designed to move away from the commonly used term  functional speech  as the outcome goal for intervention studies.",

    "text": "The benchmarks presented in Table 1 can be used for multiple purposes  (1) evaluating whether a child meets criteria for achieving the various language phases in the context of treatment research  (2) as measures to be incorporated into intervention studies  or (3) as a means for monitoring a child s progress in ongoing community treatment. Although we present our benchmarks in each of the developing phases of language, it is important to keep in mind that these phases are dynamic and overlapping periods that, in reality, have no clear boundaries. Criteria for Defining a Child s Language Level Some treatment studies include goals to advance a child s language to a particular level. For example, in studies that begin with very young or preverbal children (i.e., children who do not meet the criteria for being in the First Words phase), the goal might be to provide interventions that lead the child into becoming  verbal    which might then be defined as the First Words level. Other studies might have a more flexible goal of advancing children to the next level within a prescribed treatment period, or to chart language gains based on continuous measures (e.g., number of different consonants, words, or communication functions). Across all intervention studies, criteria for defining each language phase will facilitate the comparison of different treatment studies that may have different designs or measures. For each language phase we defined the minimum criteria for evaluating a child s language level  In order for a child to be considered to be at a particular level of expressive language functioning, the child s measured language must meet at least one of the defined minimum benchmarks in every language domain that defines that phase. This stringent approach recognizes the comprehensive developmental approach to language acquisition in children with ASD that we have proposed, one which encompasses all aspects of language used to communicate effectively with others in everyday life. Though each phase contains benchmarks for all language domains based on how language develops in typically developing children, we recognize that particularly in children with ASD there is likely to be asynchrony across different language domains (e.g., vocabulary development may be significantly more advanced than pragmatics). This will result in a mixed phase profile for many children. A child might meet minimum criteria for one phase in all domains and also meet criteria for the more advanced level in one or two domains assessed. Researchers or clinicians may choose to describe a child s language separately for each language domain in place of the criteria defining the language phase. First Words This phase represents the emergence of spoken language covering the age range of 12   18 months in typically developing children. The benchmarks targeting this phase are placed at the 15 month age-equivalent level. To conclude that a child has reached the First Words phase, he or she must meet the following criteria within each of the following domains  Phonology  meets one of the two phonological criteria presented in Table 1 based on a NLS  and Vocabulary  meets criterion for number of different words used on the NLS, or the age-equivalent criterion on a parent report measure, or the age-equivalent criterion on a direct assessment measure  and Pragmatics  Meets criterion of a minimum of 2 communicative functions, including use of spoken language to comment. Word Combinations The phase covers the age range of 18   30 months in typically developing children. The benchmarks targeting this phase are placed at the 24 month age-equivalent level. The following criteria define meeting the benchmarks for this phase  Phonology  meets one of the four phonological criteria presented in Table 1 based on a NLS  Vocabulary  meets criterion for number of different words used on the NLS or the age-equivalent criterion on a parent report measure, or the age-equivalent criterion on a direct assessment measure. The table lists one measure that focuses exclusively on vocabulary at this age range  in addition a number of direct assessment tests, for example the Mullen Scales for Early Learning (Mullen, 1995), Reynell Developmental Language Scales (Reynell   Gruber, 1990) or Preschool Language Scale-4 (Zimmerman, Steiner   Pond, 2002) all provide measures of expressive language that combine vocabulary and word combination grammar items. These measures may be used as an alternative to cover the vocabulary and grammar domains for this phase. Grammar  meets the criteria on the NLS, parent report, or direct assessment measures (see above) listed  Pragmatics  meets criterion for one of the 3 measures based on the NLS or the age-equivalent score on a parent report measure. Sentences This phase covers the broad age range from 30 to 48 months in typically developing children. The benchmarks are targeted to the 36 month age-equivalent level.",

Vocabulary  meets criterion for number of different words used on the NLS or the age-equivalent criterion on a direct assessment measure. Grammar  meets criterion for a 36 month age-equivalent score on a direct assessment measure or the MLU criterion on a NLS.

Pragmatics  meets criterion based on an elicited narrative, or the criterion for a conversational NLS, or a 36-month age-equivalent on parent report or direct assessment measures. Conclusions This report represents the consensus of our working group based on discussions carried out over the course of 18 months. We offer here the following summary and conclusions. We recommend a move away from using the term  functional speech  as a goal for intervention research and practice, replacing it with a developmental framework. We recognize that the impetus for the use of the term came from studies suggesting that achieving functional speech by age five is an important prognostic indicator in children with ASD. Nevertheless, it is not clear from the literature what definitions earlier studies relied on, though the descriptions in these studies suggest that children with optimal outcomes were able to speak in full sentences serving a range of communicative functions (Paul   Cohen, 1984). In our view, given the significant changes in the age of diagnosis and the increased access to early intensive intervention, it is time to re-open the question of the timing and role of language acquisition as key prognostic indicators in ASD. In evaluating treatment outcomes, we depend on objective measures, but we recognize that the measures available to us are imperfect. This is particularly evident when assessing the earliest phases of language in the emergence of words, grammatical combinations or the pragmatic uses of communication for which few if any standardized direct assessments are available for children under the age of two. To address these limitations we encourage the use of measures derived from natural language samples and parent report. We recognize that the collection, transcription and coding of natural language samples involves increased labor costs in research and clinical settings. However, we believe this cost cannot be avoided if we are to ensure that the data gathered have the highest degree of validity possible. We provide objective criteria for defining children s expressive language development in order to provide guidance to researchers and clinicians who assess language in young children with ASD. These may be used to guide intervention research as well as treatment offered in clinical settings. The use of benchmarks based on typical development for charting children s progress reflects findings that language development in early ASD generally follows a similar developmental pathway as in other children (Tager-Flusberg et al., 2005). Using benchmarks from typical development also draws attention to those typical language milestones that should be targeted by early intervention programs. These definitions and benchmarks will allow comparisons of outcomes across different studies. Finally, we set ourselves a practical goal  to provide a common vocabulary for discussing language acquisition to a wide interdisciplinary professional and lay audience. The terms selected for the benchmarks are intended to be transparent, reflecting important language features that define them. For each benchmark, we have provided definitions for behavior that can be objectively assessed by a broad range of early intervention professionals. The framework we have developed here should be expanded in several ways  (1) incorporating benchmarks for identifying a range of preverbal communication skills  (2) development of valid and reliable measures of language comprehension for children with ASD  (3) adaptation of the framework for assessing children who communicate using AAC systems  and (4) evaluating the relative merits of different types of measures for children with ASD. Further research is needed to address these important issues, nevertheless, we hope that the concepts and recommendations presented in this paper will enhance early intervention research targeting spoken language development in ASD and will provide clinical professionals the ability to extract and clearly define important information about treatment effectiveness in their work.

It affects brain function, particularly in the areas of social interaction and communication skills. Classic symptoms include delayed talking, lack of interest in playing with other children, not wanting to be held or cuddled and poor eye contact. There is no known cause for ASD, but both genetics and environment are believed to play a role. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates one in every 36 American children has been identified with ASD. Boys are more likely to be diagnosed with autism than girls. People with ASD often may repeat behaviors or have narrow, restricted interests. These types of behavior can affect eating habits and food choices, which can lead to the following health concerns. Limited food selection or strong food dislikes. Someone with autism may be sensitive to the taste, smell, color and texture of foods. They may limit or totally avoid some foods and even whole food groups. Dislikes may include strongly flavored foods, fruits and vegetables or certain textures such as slippery or soft foods. Not eating enough food. Kids with autism may have difficulty focusing on one task for an extended period of time. It may be hard for a child to sit down and eat a meal from start to finish. Constipation. This problem may be caused by a child s limited food choices, low physical activity levels or medications. It typically can be remedied by gradually increasing sources of dietary fiber, such as bran cereals, fruits and vegetables, along with plenty of fluids and regular physical activity. Medication interactions. Some stimulant medications used with autism can lower appetite. This can reduce the amount of food a child eats, which may affect growth. Other medications may increase appetite or affect the absorption of certain vitamins and minerals. If your child takes medication, ask your health care provider about possible side effects. For children with ASD, a nutritious, balanced eating plan can make a world of difference in their ability to learn, how they manage their emotions and how they process information. Because children with ASD often avoid certain foods or have restrictions on what they eat, as well as difficulty sitting through mealtimes, they may not be getting all the nutrients they need. If you have a child with ASD, try these nutrition-focused strategies. Be Prepared for Pickiness Many parents find their child s sensitivity to tastes, colors, smells and textures are the biggest barriers to a balanced eating plan. Getting your child to try new foods   especially those that are soft and slippery   may seem nearly impossible. You may find that your child avoids certain foods or even entire food groups. One of the easiest ways to approach sensory issues is to tackle them outside of the kitchen. Have your child visit the supermarket with you to choose a new food. When you get home, research it together on the internet to learn about where it grows. Then, decide together how to prepare it. When you are done, don t worry if your child doesn t want to eat it. Simply becoming familiar with new foods in a low-pressure, positive way eventually can help your child become a more flexible eater. Make Mealtimes Routine A child with ASD will have to work harder at mealtimes because a busy kitchen, bright lights and even the way the furniture is arranged all are potential stressors. Making meals as predictable and routine as possible can help. Serving meals at the same time every day is one of the simplest ways to reduce stress. In addition, think about what concessions you can make for easier mealtimes. If your child is sensitive to lights, try dimming them or consider using lamps or candlelight with adult supervision instead of an overhead light. Let your child pick a favorite food to include at every meal. Or, let your child choose a favorite seat at the table. Seek Guidance for Special Diets You may have heard that a gluten- or casein-free diet can improve symptoms of ASD. Gluten is a type of protein found in wheat, rye and barley. Casein is a protein found in milk. Proponents of the diet believe people with autism have a  leaky gut,  or intestine, which allows parts of gluten and casein to seep into the bloodstream and affect the brain and central nervous system. The belief is that this may lead to autism or magnify its symptoms. However, controlled scientific studies have not proven this to be true, so the research at this time does not support the use of these diets. Keep in mind that restrictive diets require careful planning to make sure your child s nutrition needs are being met.",

    "text": "Parent-led strategies to support communication in children with autism spectrum disorder By Marta Chmielowicz This article has been republished with permission. You may view the original article, published on December 30, 2024, at Autism Spectrum News. When Mukri Yilma noticed her son Kibur s use of words and gestures starting to fade at 22 months, she knew something was wrong. Suddenly, he was not waving  hi  or pointing at airplanes anymore, and he stopped using words that had been part of his vocabulary. Concerned, Mukri took Kibur to his pediatrician, where a screening found that he was at high risk for autism. A developmental pediatrician confirmed Kibur s autism diagnosis and Mukri s search for early intervention services began. Going into the pediatrician, I already suspected that he was on the autism spectrum,  says Mukri. I couldn t really face my emotions at the time because I felt like if I lingered in my own emotions, I wouldn t be successful in getting him what he needed. But my thinking was so wrong because these things don t just go away they come back much bigger if you don t deal with them right away. Soon after Kibur s diagnosis, Mukri signed up for the World Health Organization s Caregiver Skills Training (CST) program, supported by Autism Speaks. Run by the Ethiopian Eritrean Special Needs Community (EESNC), a local organization serving Ethiopian families in Maryland, the program was a turning point for her family. Respond and expand  is a core Caregiver Skills Training strategy to improve communication skills. What is Caregiver Skills Training (CST)  CST is an evidence-based, parent-mediated intervention designed for parents and caregivers of children with developmental disorders, including autism, between the ages of 2 and 9 (World Health Organization, 2022). Delivered in 12 sessions, including nine group training sessions and three home visits, the program teaches caregivers how to use everyday play and home routines as opportunities to build their child s communication, engagement, positive behavior, and daily living skills, all at no cost to families (World Health Organization, 2022  Salomone et al., 2019). Research shows that the strategies taught in CST help children with developmental delays build critical communication and emotional regulation skills while also increasing caregiver confidence and self-efficacy and reducing stress (Seng et al., 2022  Sengupta et al., 2023  Salomone et al., 2022a, 2022b  Tekola et al., 2019). CST taught me the best way possible to help my child grow,  says Mukri. I learned how to play with him, how to manage his challenging behaviors, and how to manage my own emotions. I started seeing the best of him when my husband and I changed our strategies. I think this program is very important because it closes the gap between now and when you get services. If services are interrupted, you still have some knowledge to do what you need to do to support your child. Today, Mukri is a CST trainer and an advocate for other parents walking the same path. Here are some of the practical strategies she learned through CST and how they impacted her family. Building engagement through child-led play Mukri initially struggled to connect with her son through play. Growing up in Ethiopia, play between children was common, while parents were more involved with their child s education. Through CST, she learned the importance of play in fostering her son s development. One of the most important lessons that I learned was about play,  says Mukri. I learned to declutter to have an area just for me and my son to play and to let him lead the play. I set aside time every day to engage with him one-on-one. It s not a lot of time, sometimes just 10 or 15 minutes, but spending that time together without any interruption is one of the most important lessons. CST encourages caregivers to simplify their play area, offering just two or three activities and letting the child choose the one they prefer. For example, a parent might hold up a picture book in one hand and blocks in the other, observing which the child selects through their gaze, gestures, or words. CST focuses on helping parents to pay attention to what their child is interested in,  says Pamela Dixon, Ph.D., director of clinical services and inclusion at Autism Speaks. We call it  look and listen. They re taught to follow the child s gaze and to follow that as an area of play. The reason for that is people are more likely to spend time doing things that they like. The intention is to spend as much time as possible engaged with the child because we have research that shows joint engagement promotes language development. Expanding language step-by-step Once a child is engaged in joint play, parents can help them build language skills by imitating their play while pairing language with the action.",

    "text": "If the child is playing with blocks and tries to say the word  block  but can only say  b,  the parent builds on that and says  block,   explains Dr. Dixon. If the child has more language and says  train,  the adult would add another word  train go. The idea is to imitate the child and expand on what the child is saying. Dr. Dixon describes this as  respond and expand,  a core CST strategy. Using gestures is also an important part of this process. If a child uses one word, a parent might use two and combine it with a gesture like a finger point or an open palm. This method has been very effective in improving Kibur s communication skills. Murki says that when they first started CST, Kibur could only speak in one-word responses. She learned to gently build on his attempts by modeling slightly more advanced language. I learned to set a goal based on my child s level of communication. So, if he was using one word, our goal would be to use two words. If he said,  water,  I d respond with,  drink water. Over time, he learned to say full sentences,  she explained. Caregiver Skills Training brings together parents and caregivers in a supportive learning environment. Understanding the communication behind behavior CST also taught Mukri to reframe her understanding of meltdowns and other challenging behaviors. The program teaches that behavior is a type of communication, so understanding the cause of the behavior is critical to reducing it. You can do that by going back to the earliest skill we teach, which is  look and listen,   explains Dr. Dixon. Pay attention to why the behavior is happening. It could be to get a need met, express discomfort, or communicate a want. By observing the child and paying attention to what they re looking at, you can get a sense of why that behavior is occurring and then match an intervention or a strategy with that behavior. For example, if a child frequently has meltdowns in a certain aisle in the grocery store, it might be because they want something. With this knowledge in hand, parents can choose to avoid that aisle or give the child something to hold so that they have a distraction. If the meltdown still occurs, the best thing to do is provide a calming presence be quiet and let it pass. Parents need to learn to regulate their own emotions first, as children mirror their caregivers  responses,  says Dr. Dixon. This soothing presence helps de-escalate situations. One helpful tool that CST teaches for emotional regulation is imagining a  behavior thermometer  with three levels  cool, warm, and hot. When a child is cool, they are alert but not overstimulated. Warm means that they are beginning to become dysregulated, and hot is a full-blown tantrum or other challenging behavior. By observing their child s behavior when they are cool, caregivers can see the signs of an incoming meltdown and intervene. Sometimes, when Kibur is having a behavioral problem, I just want to pick him up and hold him because comforting him helps comfort me. But I ve learned that actually makes things worse,  says Mukri. Now, when he is having a meltdown, the first thing I do is check in with myself and take a deep breath. Then, I try to understand what happened before that behavior. Over time, you become a mini parent scientist because you re collecting data on what s happening before the behavior, and you begin to see trends. Then, you can work with therapists to intervene. The impact of CST The transformation Mukri and her son have experienced after participating in CST has been profound. Her son now speaks in full-length sentences, plays with his younger brother, engages with his family, and advocates for himself. I see so much progress in Kibur s communication skills, behavior, emotional regulation, and everything else. And I see changes in myself and my husband. We are much more understanding and aware of Kibur s needs, and we are setting aside time for self-care so we can be strong and healthy for our kids. CST has also helped Mukri become a better advocate for Kibur. Because we have this special time bonding, it helped me know his weaknesses and his strengths, and it gave me a voice during his IEP meetings and therapy evaluations. It propelled me to be a better advocate and, most importantly, a voice for my son.",

    "text": "Autism Spectrum DisorderWhat is autism spectrum disorder  Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neurological and developmental disorder that affects how people interact with others, communicate, learn, and behave. Although autism can be diagnosed at any age, it is described as a  developmental disorder  because symptoms generally appear in the first two years of life. According to the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5) , a guide created by the American Psychiatric Association that health care providers use to diagnose mental disorders and developmental disorders, people with ASD often have   Difficu lty with social communication and interaction with other people  Rest ricted interests and repetitive behaviors  Symp toms that affect their ability to function in school, work, and other areas of life Autism is known as a  spectrum  disorder because people with autism have a range of characteristics, needs, strengths, and challenges. People of all ages, races, ethnicities, sexes, and economic backgrounds can be diagnosed with ASD. Although ASD can be a lifelong disorder, treatments, services, and supports can improve a person s health, well-being, and daily functioning. T he American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for autism. Caregivers should talk to their child s health care provider about ASD screening or evaluation. Wha t are the signs and symptoms of ASD  The list below gives some examples of different types of behaviors that are common among people diagnosed with ASD. Not all people with ASD will have all behaviors, but most will have several of the behaviors listed below. Social communication and social interaction behaviors may include   Maki ng little or inconsistent eye contact  Appe aring not to look at or listen to people who are talking  Infr equently sharing interest, emotion, or enjoyment of objects or activities (including infrequently pointing at or showing things to others)  Not re sponding or being slow to respond to one s name or other verbal bids for attention  Havi ng difficulties with the back and forth of conversation  Ofte n talking at length about a subject of interest without considering social cues or conversational give-and-take  Disp laying facial expressions, movements, and gestures that do not match what is being said  Having an unusual tone of voice that may sound flat, lacking emotion or tonal variation  Having trouble understanding another person s point of view or being unable to predict or understand other people s actions  Difficulties adjusting behavior to different social situations  Difficulties sharing in imaginative play or in making friends Restrictive repetitive behaviors may include   Repeating certain behaviors or having unusual behaviors, such as repeating words or phrases (a behavior called echolalia )  Having a lasting intense interest in specific topics, such as numbers, details, or facts  Showing overly focused interests, such as with moving objects or with parts of objects  Becoming upset by slight changes in a routine and having difficulty with transitions Autistic people often have sensory differences such as   Being more sensitive or less sensitive than other people to sensory input, such as light, sound, clothing, or temperature People with ASD also may experience sleep problems and irritability. People on the autism spectrum also may have many strengths, including   Being able to learn things in detail and remember information for long periods of time  Being strong visual and auditory learners  Excelling in math, science, music, or art What causes ASD  Researchers do not know the primary causes of ASD, but studies suggest that a person s genes and aspects of their environment may affect development in ways that lead to ASD. Some factors that are associated with an increased likelihood of developing ASD include   Having a sibling with ASD  Having older parents  Having a very low birth weight  Having certain genetic conditions (such as Down syndrome or Fragile X syndrome) Not everyone who has these factors will develop ASD. How is ASD diagnosed  Health care providers diagnose ASD by evaluating a person s behavior and development. ASD can usually be reliably diagnosed by the age of 2. It is important to seek an evaluation as soon as possible. The earlier ASD is diagnosed, the sooner treatments and services can begin.Diagnosis in young children Diagnosis in young children is often a two-stage process. Stage 1  General developmental screening during well-child checkups Every child should receive well-child checkups with a pediatrician or an early childhood health care provider. The American Academy of Pediatrics recommends that all children receive screening for developmental delays at their 9-, 18-, and 24- or 30-month well-child visits, with specific autism screenings at the 18- and 24-month well-child visits.",

    "text": "A child may receive additional screenings if they have an increased likelihood of developing ASD or developmental problems. Considering caregivers  experiences and concerns is an important part of the screening process for young children. The health care provider may ask questions about the child s behaviors and evaluate those answers together with information from ASD screening tools and clinical observations of the child. To learn more about ASD screening, visit the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) website at www.cdc.gov autism diagnosis . The health care provider may refer the child for additional evaluation if they show developmental differences in behavior or functioning during this screening process. Stage 2  Additional diagnostic evaluation It is important to accurately detect and diagnose children with ASD as early as possible, as this will shed light on their unique strengths and challenges. Early detection can also help caregivers determine which services, educational programs, and behavioral therapies are most likely to be helpful for their child. A team of health care providers who have experience diagnosing ASD will conduct the diagnostic evaluation. This team may include child neurologists, developmental behavioral pediatricians, speech-language pathologists, child psychologists and psychiatrists, educational specialists, and occupational therapists. The diagnostic evaluation is likely to include   Medical and neurological examinations  Assessment of the child s cognitive abilities  Assessment of the child s speech and language abilities  Observation of the child s behavior  An in-depth conversation with the child s caregivers about the child s behavior and development  Assessment of age-appropriate skills needed to complete daily activities independently, such as eating, dressing, and toileting  Questions about the child s family historyBecause ASD is a complex disorder that sometimes occurs with other conditions or learning disorders, the comprehensive evaluation may include blood tests and a hearing test. The outcome of this evaluation may result in a formal diagnosis and recommendations for treatment. Diagnosis in older children and adolescents Caregivers and teachers are often the first to recognize ASD symptoms in older children and adolescents. The school s special education team may perform an initial evaluation and then recommend that a child receive additional evaluation from their primary health care provider or a health care provider who specializes in ASD. A child s caregivers may talk with these health care providers about the child s social difficulties, including problems with subtle communication. These subtle communication differences may include problems understanding tone of voice, facial expressions, or body language. Older children and adolescents may have trouble understanding figures of speech, humor, or sarcasm. They also may have challenges forming friendships with peers. It is also important for the health care provider to learn about the child s strengths so they can tailor their recommendations for services and supports. Diagnosis in adults Diagnosing ASD in adults is often more difficult than diagnosing ASD in children. In adults, some ASD symptoms can overlap with symptoms of mental disorders such as an anxiety disorder or attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). Adults who have questions about whether they may be on the autism spectrum should talk with a health care provider and ask for a referral for an ASD evaluation. Although evaluation for ASD in adults is still being refined, adults can be referred to a neuropsychologist, psychologist, or psychiatrist who has experience with ASD. The expert will ask about   Social interaction and communication challenges  Sensory issues  Repetitive behaviors  Restricted interests The evaluation may also include a conversation with caregivers and family members to learn about the person s early developmental history, which can help ensure an accurate diagnosis. Obtaining a correct diagnosis of ASD as an adult can help people understand past challenges, identify personal strengths, and find the right kind of help. Studies are underway to determine the types of services and supports that are most helpful for autistic transition-age youth and adults. What treatments and services are available for ASD  Interventions, services, and supports for ASD are most effective when they begin as soon as possible after diagnosis. Receiving appropriate care and services can help address a person s specific needs and challenges while also helping them learn new skills and build on their strengths. People with ASD have a wide range of issues and needs, which means there is no single best approach. Working closely with health care and service providers is an important part of finding the right combination of interventions, services, and supports.",

Here are some tips for finding these additional resources   Con tact a health care provider, local health department, school, community center, or autism advocacy group to learn about special programs or loc al resources. Find an autism support group. Sharing information and experiences can help people with autism and their caregivers learn about treatment options andautism-related programs. Kee p records of your conversations and meetings with health care providers and teachers. This information helps when it is time to decide which programsand services are appropriate.

Using post-mortem brain tissue samples from 112 individuals with or without ASD, Michael Gandal and colleagues analyzed gene expression in 11 cortical regions by se - quencing RNA from each of the four main cortical lobes. They report that in samples from individuals with ASD, they saw chang - es across the cerebral cortex,  affecting many neural cell types and speci  c biologi - cal processes. They also found evidence that RNA changes in the brain are a cause of ASD, rather than a result of the disorder. Previous research by the same team had focused on the temporal and frontal lobes, which are involved in language and social cognition. This time, however, they were surprised to   nd that  the most profound gene-expression changes in ASD were observed in the primary visual cortex. They note,  It is interesting to speculate that the substantial changes observed in primary sen - sory regions may relate to the widespread sensory processing differences in ASD, which are so pervasive that they have been included in the DSM-5 diagnostic criteria.

However, the study suggests that infants who experienced their   rst year of life during the pandemic have an elevated risk of communication impair- ment, regardless of gestational exposure to SARS-CoV-2, and that children of mothers infected with the virus may have an elevated risk of   ne motor problems. Kamran Hessami and colleagues ana- lyzed data from eight studies involving a total of 21,419 infants who were screened using the Ages and Stages Questionnaires (ASQ-3). Of the infants, 11,438 were screened dur - ing the pandemic period, and 9,981 prior to the pandemic. The researchers say that the pandemic cohort was more likely to exhibit communication impairments, but showed no signi  cant differences in gross motor,   ne motor, personal-social, and problem-solving skills. In addition, they say, maternal infec - tion  was not associated with signi  cant dif - ferences in any neurodevelopment domain in offspring, except for increasing the odds of   ne motor impairment. The   ndings suggest, they say,  that overall neurodevelopment in the   rst year of life was not changed by either being born or raised during the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic or by gestational exposure to SARS-CoV-2.",

Martin Brynge and colleagues analyzed data from nearly 550,000 children in Stock- holm, Sweden. Approximately 34,000 of the children s mothers had documented evidence of an infection during pregnancy requiring specialized health care. Consistent with earlier studies, the re- searchers found that children exposed to in- fections in utero had a higher likelihood of receiving an autism diagnosis, as well as an increased risk of being diagnosed with intel- lectual disability. However, they found that maternal infections occurring in the year prior to pregnancy were associated with au- tism as well a   nding that casts doubt on the theory that the infections that occurred during pregnancy were the cause of autism. In addition, the researchers analyzed data from nearly 400,000 children in the study group who had full siblings. They found that siblings exposed to maternal in- fections were not at higher risk for autism compared to their unexposed siblings. The researchers conclude,  Although in- fections in pregnant women are associated with both autism and intellectual disability in their children, the association with autism does not appear to re  ect a causal relation - ship, but is more likely to be explained by factors shared between family members such as genetic variation or aspects of the shared environment. Thus, infection preven- tion is not expected to reduce autism inci- dence. The researchers note, however, that their   ndings apply only to infections in general, and not to speci  c viruses for example, ru - bella and cytomegalovirus that are   rmly linked to an increased risk for autism and other developmental disabilities. They also note that their data could not rule out a caus- al link between maternal infection during pregnancy and intellectual disability.

Abnormal white matter microstructure has been linked to au- tism spectrum disorders (ASD) as well as depression and anxiety. In their research, Anne-Claire Binter and colleagues studied the air pollution ex- posure of more than 3,500 children enrolled in a study in the Netherlands. To determine each child s exposure to air pollution during the study period, the researchers estimated the daily levels of nitrogen dioxide and par- ticulate matter in the children s homes on a month-by-month basis during the mother s pregnancy and throughout childhood, until the children reached 8.5 years of age. When participants were between 9 and 12 years of age, the researchers performed magnetic resonance imaging to examine the structural connectivity of their white matter and to measure the volumes of several brain struc- tures. The researchers found an association between greater exposure to pollutants be- fore 5 years of age and more signi  cant al - terations in brain structure at 9 to 12 years of age. In addition, they detected a link between exposure to   ne particulate mat - ter especially during the   rst two years of life and an increased volume of the puta- men during preadolescence. The putamen is a brain structure involved in motor function, learning processes, and many other func- tions, and Binter notes that a larger putamen has been associated with ASD, schizophre- nia, and obsessive-compulsive spectrum disorders. She comments,  The novel aspect of the present study is that it identi  ed periods of susceptibility to air pollution. We measured exposure using a   ner time scale by ana - lyzing the data on a month-by-month basis, Early exposure to pollutants may alter brain s deve lopment unlike previous studies in which data was analyzed for trimesters of pregnancy or childhood years. She also notes that the levels of air pollution to which the children were exposed met European Union (EU) standards, suggesting that brain develop - ment can be affected by exposure to levels of pollution currently considered acceptable. She adds,  One of the important con- clusions of this study is that the... brain is particularly susceptible to the effects of air pollution not only during pregnancy, as has been shown in earlier studies, but also dur- ing childhood.

IN MEMORIAM Dan Torisky, a powerful advo- cate for children and adults with autism, passed away on November 10, 2022. When his oldest son, Edward, was diagnosed with autism, Mr. To- risky left a successful career in ad- vertising to devote his life to autism advocacy. He served as president of the Autism Society from 1990 to 1994, and later became president of the Autism Society of Pittsburgh (now Autism-Pittsburgh). Mr. Torisky was instrumental in establishing residential and educa - tional programs for individuals with autism throughout the Pittsburgh area. He co-founded the Spectrum Charter School for Autistic and Developmentally Disabled Adoles - cents, the   rst autism-speci  c char - ter school in the United States. In addition, he helped found the Pitts- burgh Vintage Grand Prix, which raises funds for autism services. His decades of service have improved the lives of autistic individuals in Pittsburgh and around the world. 224693 80171 ARI-Vol36No4NL.indd 2224693 80171 ARI-Vol36No4NL.indd 2 12 19 22 2 08 PM12 19 22 2 08 PMAUTISM RESEARCH REVIEW INTERNATIONAL Page 3 V ol. 36, No. 4, 2022 Treating autism with contingent electric shock  Are all possible options really considered EDITORIAL  Stephen M.

    "text": "Although most people in the autism commu - nity strongly disagree with using any form of punishment as a therapeutic approach, aversives continue to be a source of discus - sion and controversy. Recently, the Associ - ation for Behavior Analysis International, a renowned professional organization es - tablished in 1974, asked their members to vote on whether contingent electric shock should be entirely ruled out or be appropri - ate in some cases. Given the recent renewed interest in aversives, I thought it would be timely to share my thoughts on this topic. Over the past 50  years, much has been written about using aversive interventions to treat those on the autism spectrum. Aver- sives involve mild to severe degrees of dis- comfort or pain, from saying the word  no  or making a loud noise to more extreme forms such as forced ammonia inhalation, blindfolding, and electric shock  1-3 . Although aversives can be moderately effective in reducing challenging behaviors, such as self-injurious behavior (SIB) and aggression toward others, critics often use the words  cruel  and  torture  to describe extreme forms of aversives. However, some forms of aversives are currently accepted by the general professional community. For in- stance, aversives including contingent elec- tric shock (CES) are sometimes employed to treat addictions in the general population including alcoholism, gambling, and smok- ing  4-6 . In this editorial, I will address CES giv- en a legal decision rendered last year (July 2021)  7 . Basically, a judge allowed the utilization of CES for clients who engaged in severe challenging behaviors potentially leading to harm to others or to themselves. This ruling applies only to clients at the Judge Rotenberg Educational Center in Canton, Massachusetts. The ruling affects about one-  fth of the approximately 300 clients at the center. However, this decision can now be referred to in other legal cases involving similar situations. CES should not be confused with elec- troconvulsive therapy (ECT). The former is applied immediately, usually within sec- onds, after a challenging behavior, such as self-harming behavior or aggression. The latter, ECT, involves administering elec- tric current into the brain to induce a brief seizure. ECT has been given to some indi- viduals on the spectrum to treat severe self- injurious behavior  8  and catatonia  9 . Research on CES started in the mid- 1960s, soon after autism was recognized as a biological condition as opposed to a condition caused by emotional neglect by parents. Early studies typically involved single-subject controlled experiments. Over the years, few studies have been reported in the literature. Today, CES is, for the most part, not con- sidered a viable form of intervention within the autism community. In addition, the Food and Drug Administration banned CES in the United States  10 , and the United Nations has stated that CES is dehumanizing and abusive  11 . The use of CES over the decades was never widespread  however, it was some - times employed as a last resort since SIB can lead to severe self-in  icted harm, such as lacerations, bone fractures, and concussions. There are also reports of individuals blind - ing themselves in addition to biting off their   ngers or part of their tongue. One rationale people have used when condoning CES is to avoid other  less desirable  options includ - ing long-term sedation or restraint. Several methods have been used to de- liver CES including (1) an electrical prod, (2) an electrical grid embedded in the   oor, (3) a remote-controlled device activated by a therapist, and (4) an automated movement sensor. Regarding the latter, the Self-Injuri- ous Behavior Inhibiting System (SIBIS) was created to control head-banging by placing a sensor on the child s head that would deliver a signal to activate a shock to the arm or leg  12 . How should we approach the treatment of severe challenging behaviors  Edward Carr, one of the leading experts in treating challenging behaviors, would often tell a heart-wrenching story about the time he attempted to treat a young man on the spectrum who engaged in severe SIB  13 . Dr. Carr s team developed a behavioral strategy that involved giving CES immedi- ately after the man engaged in head-hitting. The intervention was moderately success- ful in that the frequency of head-hitting decreased but was not entirely eliminated. Later, the team learned that the man suf- fered from migraine headaches. One could imagine how an individual would feel when experiencing both a severe head pain and electric shock. In a recent interview in the Boston Globe , a father described his son who had blinded himself in one eye and exhibited numerous challenging behaviors (August 1, 2021)  14 . After receiving CES, he stopped poking his other eye. Other bene  ts seen in the child were also attributed to the CES, including improvements in communication and self-help skills.",

    "text": "However, it is important to mention that one research study demonstrated a dramatic reduction in eye-poking behavior in a group of autistic children after receiving liquid calcium  15 . This is because some-to-many individuals who exhibit this type of behav- ior suffer from hypocalcemia. One possible explanation for eye-poking is that low cal- cium levels are associated with dry eye syn- drome, which may lead to in  ammation on the surface of the eyes and or the eyelids as well as cause a burning sensation  16, 17 . Thus, giving an individual a simple nutri- tional supplement may be bene  cial when treating behavior directed toward the eyes. Unfortunately, this treatment is not well- known among clinicians. The use of CES, as almost always ar- gued, is considered after attempting all other possible options for intervention. Although this may sound convincing and commend- able, the term  all  can be considered a misnomer because this really depends on the knowledge-base as well as the training of the members of the clinical team as well as outside consultants. Given the limited amount of research and the lack of wide- spread knowledge about the biology of chal- lenging behaviors, one can easily question whether the decision to administer electric shock is truly reasonable and thorough. There is mounting evidence indicating that internal discomfort or pain may be as- sociated with SIB. Unfortunately, many individuals on the autism spectrum have impaired communication skills. As a result, they often cannot express their feelings of discomfort and pain. Comorbidities associ- ated SIB include gastrointestinal problems  18 , immune system issues  19 , metabolic problems  20 , seizures  21 , abnormal sen- sory processing  22 , nutritional issues  23 , anxiety  24 , and sleep problems  25 . Obviously, it can be a daunting task to assess all possibilities when determining the underlying reasons for a severe behavior, but it is crucial that an all-out effort be made. continued on page 7Given the limited amount of research and the lack of widespread knowledge about the biology of challenging behaviors, one can easily question whether the decision to administer electric shock is truly reason- able and thorough. 224693 80171 ARI-Vol36No4NL.indd 3224693 80171 ARI-Vol36No4NL.indd 3 12 19 22 2 08 PM12 19 22 2 08 PMResearch UpdatesAUTISM RESEARCH REVIEW INTERNATIONAL Page 4 V ol. 36, No. 4, 2022 Exercise may help to lower levels of anxiety in ASDMore findings point to high rate of vitamin D deficiency in children with autismDifferences detected in ASD in gene variations linked to insomnia, circadian rhythm Moving  Please let us know well in advance, so your next issue will reach you on time Children with autism spectrum disor- ders (ASD) may have an increased genetic risk for sleep problems, according to a new study. Rackeb Tesfaye and colleagues analyzed data from two large databases including 5,860 children with ASD and 2,092 unaf- fected siblings. In addition, they analyzed data on 7,509 individuals from the general population. The researchers focused on copy num- ber variants (CNVs) which are deletions or duplications of large sections of DNA  that are associated with circadian rhythm and insomnia. They report,  Deletions and duplications with circadian genes were overrepresented in ASD probands com- pared to siblings and unselected controls. For insomnia-risk genes, deletions but not duplications were associated with ASD. These results remained signi  cant after the researchers adjusted for cognitive ability. Interestingly, the researchers determined from parent reports that circadian genes did not appear to in  uence sleep problems in the children with ASD. They speculate that the databases they used may have lacked the de- tailed information needed to identify the full range of sleep problems frequently seen in these children. Another possibility, they say, is that circadian and insomnia genes con- tribute to ASD in ways that do not involve sleep for instance, by affecting cognition or hormone secretion.

They report that somatic symptoms, panic, and generalized anxiety, as measured by the Screen for Child Anxiety Related Emotional Disorders, were inversely associ- ated with the average daily minutes spent in vigorous exercise, and total anxiety scores on this measure were inversely associated with daily duration of moderate-to-vigorous exercise. In addition, emotional symptoms, as measured by the Strengths and Dif  cul - ties Questionnaire, were inversely associat- ed with average daily time spent in vigorous or moderate-to-vigorous exercise. The researchers also found that symp- toms associated with ASD, such as social problems, repetitive behavior, or motor problems, were not related to levels of phys- ical activity. This suggests that differences in ASD symptoms do not play a signi  cant role in the the amount of physical activity engaged in by children with ASD.

They divided the children into four subcategories based on their diagnoses  autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorders not oth - erwise speci  ed (PDD-NOS), and other di - agnoses related to autism. The researchers found that 48.4 percent of the children had refractive problems, most commonly hyperopia (farsightedness) and astigmatism (distorted vision due to al- terations in the shape of the cornea or lens). Myopia (nearsightedness) was more com- mon in children with Asperger syndrome, with nearly 18 percent of them exhibiting this problem.

Adults with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) appear to be better at reading emo- tions in cartoons than neurotypical people are, according to a recent study.Liam Cross and colleagues asked 98 individuals with ASD and 98 age-matched controls to view 36 photographs or cartoon drawings of eyes and to select, from four possible options, which emotion the eyes portrayed. The researchers found that indi- viduals with ASD did as well as neurotypi- cal participants when viewing the photos, and did better when looking at the cartoons. While neurotypical participants were better at identifying emotions in photos than in identifying emotions in cartoons, the per- formance of participants with ASD did not differ signi  cantly between the two tasks. Study coauthor Gray Atherton com- ments,  The fact neurotypicals did worse than autistic people on cartoon eyes raises important questions. Research suggests that this could be an area of social-cognitive strength in autistic people who seem bet- ter  than neurotypical people  at identify- ing with anthropomorphic and non-human agents like animals, robots, dolls, or car- toons . He and his colleagues say their   nd - ings support the concept of socio-cognitive differences rather than de  cits in autistic people. In addition, Cross says, the   ndings sug - gest new avenues for helping individuals with ASD respond to real faces. One idea we are exploring,  he says,  is using aug- mented reality to develop   lters that can apply anthropomorphic faces over the top of real-life faces. Over time, the augmented reality can be stripped away, allowing the user to apply the same techniques to human faces.

Danielle Roubinov and colleagues stud- ied data collected from 86 mother-child pairs. Half of the mothers had children with ASD, and half had neurotypical children. The children were between two years and 16 years of age at the beginning of the study, although most were elementary-school age or younger. Collecting data from the pairs three times over a period of two years, the re- searchers found that about 50 percent of mothers of children with ASD had elevated levels of depressive symptoms at each in- terval. In contrast, only 5.9 percent, 13.6 percent, or 9.5 percent of mothers with neu- rotypical children (depending on the time frame) exhibited depression. The researchers found that regardless of ASD status, child behavior problems pre- dicted higher levels of maternal depression later on. However, maternal depression did not predict later increases in child behavior problems. They conclude,  Parents who seek support for their children s behavior problems are often referred to programs to improve parenting (and parenting stress), with limited attention to caregivers  own mental health problems. Given the burden of depression, we contend that support for mothers is important even when children are the  target patients.

    "text": "and   Half of moms of kids with autism have high depressive symptoms,  news release, University of California, San Francisco, August 26, 2022.Most studies on autism spectrum dis- orders (ASD) include very few female subjects an issue that could signi  cantly affect the validity of research   ndings for women with ASD and a new paper sug- gests that this dearth of female subjects stems in large part from the use of one spe- ci  c screening test. While enrolling participants in their own research, Anila D Mello and col - leagues observed that the Autism Diagnos- tic Observation Schedule (ADOS) appeared to have unequal effects on male and female participation. Analyzing an MIT database of adults with ASD who had expressed in - terest in participating in research studies, they found that approximately half of the females in the database met the ADOS cut - off scores typically required for inclusion in autism studies, compared to 80 percent of the males. D Mello says,  We realized then that there s a discrepancy and that the ADOS is essentially screening out who eventually participated in research. We were really sur- prised at how many males we retained and how many females we lost to the ADOS. To investigate this issue further, the re- searchers examined six other datasets in- cluding more than 40,000 adults diagnosed with ASD. They found that in datasets that required ADOS screening for eligibility, the ratio of male to female participants was around 8 1. In datasets that required only a community diagnosis, the ratios ranged from around 2 1 to 1 1. These results,  the researchers say,  provide evidence for a  leaky  recruitment-to-research pipeline for females in autism research. D Mello notes that the ADOS was origi- nally developed using a largely male sample, which may explain why it excludes many women. She says,   It  might be that it s not great at picking up the female phenotype, which may differ in certain ways primar- ily in domains like social communication. She concludes,  If the research is saying that there aren t females with autism, or that the brain basis of autism only looks like the patterns established in males, then you re not really helping females as much as you could be, and you re not really getting at the truth of what the disorder might be.

(see related story below) A new study suggests that administering the Autism Diagnostic Observation Sched- ule (ADOS) may not be necessary in order for clinicians to accurately diagnose autism spectrum disorders (ASD). Developed for use in research studies, the ADOS is cur- rently considered to be part of the  gold standard  diagnosis of ASD. The study, involving 349 children be- tween 18 months and   ve years of age who did not have a prior ASD diagnosis, took place at eight sites seven in the United States and one in Europe that provided subspecialty assessments for children sus- pected to have ASD. William Barbaresi and colleagues asked developmental-behavioral pediatricians at each site to make an initial diagnosis based on clinical assessment. The ADOS was then administered, after which the pediatricians made a second diagnosis. The researchers also asked the pediatricians to describe their level of diagnostic certainty at the times of the   rst and second diagno - ses. The researchers found that there was 90 percent agreement between clinical diagno- ses alone and diagnoses including informa- tion from ADOS. In addition, they say that the clinicians  diagnostic certainty was the best predictor of consistency between the two diagnoses. Noting that the ADOS adds to the time and expense of diagnosing ASD, the re- searchers conclude,  This study suggests that the ADOS is generally not required for diagnosis of ASD in young children by developmental-behavioral pediatricians and that  these clinicians  can identify children for whom the ADOS may be needed.

The study, by Nicole Papadopoulos and colleagues, involved 123 children who par- ticipated in an intervention called Sleeping Sound ASD and 122 children who did not participate. All of the children were between 5 and 13 years of age and had moderate to severe sleep problems. Children with medi- cal conditions known to impact sleep were excluded. The researchers asked the children and parents in the intervention group to attend two 50-minute in-person sessions. It was important to involve the children in select- ing and implementing sleep strategies, they say, in order to optimize results and encour- age cooperation with the program. The   rst session focused on assessing the children s sleep problems, providing information about sleep, and setting goals. Parents and children then worked together to choose from a variety of sleep strategies in order to create individualized sleep man- agement plans. The second session focused on reinforcing sleep strategies, monitoring sleep patterns by reviewing a sleep diary, and addressing any issues reported by par- ents or children. Parents and children also participated in a phone call two weeks after the second session. The sleep intervention involved behav- ioral techniques such as these    Bedtime fading  scheduling the initial bedtime at the time when the child nor- mally fell asleep, and then moving the bedtime earlier in 15-minute increments. Graduated extinction  weaning the child from the need to have a parent in the room by having the parent visit few- er and fewer times. Offering a  bedtime pass   granting the child one  free pass  to leave the bedroom each night. Using the Children s Sleep Habits Ques- tionnaire (CSHQ) to assess the children s sleep problems three months after the start of the intervention, the researchers de- tected signi  cant improvements. Areas of improvement included bedtime resistance, sleep onset delay, sleep duration, and total CSHQ score. Smaller but still signi  cant effects were seen for sleep anxiety, night waking, and parasomnias. There was some reduction in bene  t by the six-month mark, leading the researchers to suggest a  booster session  at six months to reinforce the use of the strategies. Some improvements were seen in secondary behaviors such as inter- nalizing symptoms, emotional behavioral disturbances, and quality of life, but these were not statistically signi  cant. The researchers conclude,  The sleeping sound ASD intervention is an ef  cacious and practical way to reduce sleep problems for autistic children.

The Autism Research Institute recently launched a new webpage, www.Self-Injuri - ousBehavior.com, designed to assist profes- sionals and parents in identifying treatments that may reduce or eliminate self-injurious behavior. After answering questions regard - ing the location of the injury as well as relat- ed factors, users are directed to a description of possible underlying causes for the behav - ior. In addition, online links are presented with respect to understanding and treating the behavior. A large parent survey that collected data on almost 40,000 individuals with ASD in- dicated that 9  engaged in SIB, 19  en- gaged in aggression, and 19  engaged in both behaviors (data collected by the Au- tism Research Institute between 1964 and 2006). Given that nearly half of individu- als on the spectrum exhibit one or both of these challenging behaviors, we urge the autism community to work collaboratively to establish a consensus report on treating challenging behaviors. The goal of such an effort would be to recommend a number of behavioral, sensory, medical, and biomedi- cal approaches that could help to identify the underlying reasons for the behaviors of interest, pointing to the most appropriate treatments. We hope that the autism com- munity will welcome such a challenge and support such an endeavor. References are available at www.ARRIReferences.org.

Mumbai- 400008 E-mail id  alka.subramanyam gmail.com CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINES 2019 (Version 1.1) AUTISM These guidelines have been framed after an amalgamation of expert guidelines across the globe, and existing practices in India, as outlined by experts in the field. Due to lack of systematic research in the field of autism in India, the evidence of the said practices is not documented, which becomes a limitation of these guidelines. The good part is that India has an indigenous tool for assessment, which has been recommended by the Government of India, which we have attached as an appendix. Autism has till date always been viewed as an illness from the medical model, and hunt for a  cure  has been the norm. With increase in awareness and available therapies, the focus shifted to disability and inclusion. However, as more autistic individuals express themselves and their needs, the focus now has shifted from the medical model to the social model of neurodiversity, thereby implying that autism is actually a variant of normal human development and human diversity. The next decade will probably see how best the two paradigms can be aligned to destigmatize and integrate autistic individuals into society at large. Keeping the above in mind, the 5th edition of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM 5) shifted from grouping the disorders as separate diagnoses under the umbrella of PDDs to conceptualizing them as all members of the broader category of known as Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD). The number of core domain deficits was reduced to two (social communication and repetitive behavior). ASD would now be diagnosed when a patient demonstrated at least three symptoms in the domain of social communication and at least two symptoms of restricted interests repetitive behaviors  including an added behavior of hyper- or hypo-reactivity to sensory input or unusual interests in sensory aspects of the environment. Table 1  DSM- IV-TR vs DSM-5 DSM- IV-TR DSM-5 3 symptom categories 2 categories 6 diagnostic items endorsed in the  social impairment  category Three diagnostic items endorsed in the  social communication and social interaction  category Specifies onset prior to age 3 Specifies early development Includes Rett s, Childhood Disintegrative Disorder, Asperger s Syndrome, PDD -NOS Sub-types eliminated Includes parameters for designating severity Major Changes to the DSM-5, Autism Diagnostic Criteria   Category name changed from Pervasive Developmental Disorders to Autism Spectrum Disorders   Inclusion of sensory differences in criteria   Recommendation to identify  specifiers  to better understand the individual needs of each child with ASD (cognitive and language ability, level of supports needed, co- occurring medical and mental health conditions, catatonia)   Inclusion of co-occurring mental health disorders (e.g., attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder) The International Classification of Diseases-10th version(ICD-10), still used the term Pervasive Developmental Disorder. What is interesting is that the proposed changes in ICD-11 have not only changed the nosology to Autism Spectrum Disorder, but have also included intellectual development and functional language, which is closer to the clinical picture, and also is in keeping with the concept of neurodiversity. At a glance, when we compare these classificatory systems, below are the changes we can see.",

The latest statistics state that the prevalence of autism spectrum disorders (ASD), is now estimated at 1 in 68 , more in males, (Centre for Disease Control National Center on Birth Defects and Developmental Disabilities, USA, 2014), which is alarming rise from 1 500 less than a decade ago. The possible reason for this is increase in the number of CNV and gene variations. Multiple genes seem to be involved. These genes are responsible for synaptic plasticity, synaptic scaffolding proteins, receptors, cell adhesion molecules or proteins that are involved in chromatin remodeling, tran- scription, protein synthesis or degradation, or actin cytoskeleton dynamics.Eg. Genes for neuroligins, SHANKs, CNTNAP2, FMR1 to name a few. On analysis of neuronal growth and pathways cortico-striato-thalamo-cortical (CSTC) circuits (for repetitive behaviours), Ventral Tegmental Area (VTA) connectivity to Nucleus Accumbens (NAcc) (for social interaction), and Amydala to Ventral Hippocampal connectivity (for social interactions), are areas of active interest and study. The validit y of the same, and the translation into structural diagnostic neuro-imaging is yet to be established, and hence limits the use of the same. Similarly, functional neuropathology reveals excessive synapses due to a slow pruning process. However, diagnostic modalities to ascertain the same are yet awaited. PROCESS OF ASSESSMENT Autism being a complex disorder, the assessment should as far as possible be done by multidisciplinary team who besides the psychiatrist should include a psychologist, a special educator, an occupational therapist and an audiologist and speech therapist. In the western world, educational psychologists in school settings double up for assessment of cognition and curricular level too. Also, it is good to keep the child s paediatrician in the loop, to ensure that any physical co-morbidites are handled effectively too. Beyond longitudinal changes in ASD symptoms, the assessment of co-occurring physical and mental health conditions, is essential to providing quality care. Clinicians must actively ask about signs and symptoms of these conditions.Rule-out other conditions (e.g., hearing impairment),evaluate for co-morbid conditions (e.g., seizures) and search for underlying etiology (e.g., genetic syndrome).A medical history (birth, current health, family history), physical exam (growth, dysmorphic features, neuro, skin evaluation) and audiological evaluation, genetic testing (chromosomes, fragile x, microarray) and other optional investigations like EEG, brain imaging, metabolic testing, as appropriate might be useful depending on the nature of the case. The above approach, helps to delineate essential versus complex autism, when it comes to overall management and prognosis, as well as gives us a base on which to approach and psycho-educate the parents.

The American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) recommends that all children be screened for developmental delays and disabilities during regular well-child doctor visits viz. at 9 months, 18 months, 24 or 30 months. AACAP(American Association for Child and Adolescent Psychiatry) recommends ASD surveillance at all developmental   psychiatric assessments of children, ASD specific screening (e.g., M-CHAT) at 18 and 24 month visits or when surveillance raises concern. If the screening indicates significant ASD symptomatology, a thorough diagnostic evaluation is essential. Evaluation should include multi-disciplinary assessment with the clinician coordinating it.

The primary goal of the M-CHAT-R is to maximize sensitivity, meaning to detect as many cases of ASD as possible. Therefore, there is a high false positive rate, meaning that not all children who score at risk will be diagnosed with ASD. To address this, we have developed the Follow- Up questions (M- CHAT-R F). Users should be aware that even with the Follow-Up, a significant number of the children who screen positive on the M-CHAT-R will not be diagnosed with ASD  however, these children are at high risk for other developmental disorders or delays, and therefore, evaluation is warranted for any child who screens positive Scoring Algorithm For all items except 2, 5, and 12, the response  NO  indicates ASD risk  for items 2, 5, and 12,  YES  indicates ASD risk. The following algorithm maximizes psychometric properties of the M-CHAT- R  LOW-RISK   Total Score is 0-2  if child is younger than 24 months, screen again after second birthday. No further action required unless surveillance indicates risk for ASD. MEDIUM-RISK   Total Score is 3-7  Administer the Follow- Up (second stage of M-CHAT-R F) to get additional information about at-risk responses. If M-CHAT-R F score remains at 2 or higher, the child has screened positive. Action required  refer child for diagnostic evaluation and eligibility evaluation for early intervention. If score on Follow- Up is 0-1, child has screened negative. No further action required unless surveillance indicates risk for ASD. Child should be rescreened at future well-child visits. HIGH-RISK   Total Score is 8-20  It is acceptable to bypass the Follow- Up and refer immediately for diagnostic evaluation and eligibility evaluation for early intervention. For assessment, the common tools used are screening tools and diagnostic tools. A) Screening Tools  Screening tools are designed to help identify children who might have developmental delays.",

Screening tools do not provide conclusive evidence of developmental delays and do not result in diagnoses. A positive screening result should be followed by a thorough assessment. Screening tools do not provide in-depth information about an area of development B) Diagnostic Tools  Many diagnostic tools are available to assess ASD in young children, but no single tool should be used as the basis for diagnosis. Diagnostic tools usually rely on two main sources of information --the parents  or caregivers  descriptions of their child s development  and a profes sional s observation of the child s behaviour. In some cases, the primary care provider might choose to refer the child and family to a specialist for further assessment and diagnosis. Such specialists include child psychiatrists, geneticists, neurodevelopmental pediatricians, and early intervention programs that provide assessment services.

Alternatively, informa tion can be obtained from caregivers about the child s ASD symptoms using questionnaires. The two most commonly used are the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS, SRS-2) and the Social Communication Questionnaire (SCQ). Additional Elements of ASD Assessment In accordance with DSM-5 specifiers, some features related to ASD require additional assessment, including the presence of cognitive or language impairment (or both). Abilities in these areas can range from severely impaired to advanced. The presence of developmental delays or co-occurring diagnoses, such as Attention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder (ADHD), in addition to ASD symptoms may add complexity to the diagnostic assessment process. Given these complexities, cognitive and language assessments and consideration of comorbid emotional and behavioral disorders are recommended for all patients with ASD. ADHD particularly becomes a very important co-morbidity and confounding factor with ASD. Prevalence of ADHD symptoms in individuals with a primary clinical diagnosis of ASD has been reported to be between 13 and 50   in the general population.

This particularly holds true for those who have high functioning autism (previously Asperger  s) and hyperactivity.

Besides, there are hardly any tests which can accurately assess cognitive ability and intellect in autism.

This helps avoid both over- diagnosis and under-diagnosis. Approach to treatment Just as the ideal assessment for autism is multi-disciplinary, so too, approach to treatment involves a multi-sensory, multi-disciplinary approach. Early intervention should be the aim to yield the best outcome and results. Despite advances in early diagnosis and intervention, efficacious reversal of core autistic symptoms is still not accomplished, to date. Treatments include a range of behavioral, psychosocial, educational, medical, and complementary approaches. The options vary by age and developmental status. Chronic management is often required to maximize functional independence and quality of life by minimizing core deficits in social skills and communication, facilitating development and learning, promoting socialization, reducing maladaptive behaviors and educating and supporting families. The treatments can be broadly divided into the following  A  NON -PHARMACOLOGICAL TREATMENTS These form the mainstay of approaches towards autism. These may be divided into  a) Structured educational and behavioural interventions   i. Early Stage Denver Model(ESDM)  This aims to accelerate children s development in all domains  intervention targets derived from assessment of developmental skills  stresses social-communicative development, interpersonal engagement, imitation-based interpersonal development, and social attention and motivation i. Applied Behavioural Analysis(ABA)   ABA is probably the most widely used intervention for children as well as adults with autism. It focuses on improving specific behaviors initially using discrete trials to teach simple skills, then progressing to more complex skills and complex behaviours. It is helpful in a wide variety of skills viz. social skills, communication, reading, and academics as well as adaptive learning skills, such as fine motor dexterity, hygiene, grooming, domestic capabilities, punctuality, and job competence. ABA is effective for children and adults with psychological disorders in a variety of settings, including schools, workplaces, homes, and clinics. It has also been shown that consistent ABA can significantly improve behaviors and skills and decrease the need for special services. Ideally more than 20 hours per wee k, under the age of 4 is recommended. ABA also helps in minimizing negative behaviours. In autistic adults, ABA can help with memory, relationships and cognitive strength. ii. SCERTS  This is an educational model which uses practices from other approaches including ABA, TEACCH, Floortime and RDI. The SCERTS Model differs most notably from the focus of ABA, by promoting child-initiated communication in everyday activities. SCERTS is most concerned with helping children with autism to achieve progress, which is defined as the ability to learn and spontaneously apply functional and relevant skills in a variety of settings and with a variety of partners. The acronym SCERTS refers to the focus on  SC  Social Communication - Development of spontaneous, functional communication, emotional expression and secure and trusting relationships with children and adults. ER  Emotional Regulation - Development of the ability to maintain a well-regulated emotional state to cope with everyday stress, and to be most available for learning and interacting.",

    "text": "TS  Transactional Support - Development and implementation of supports to help partners respond to the child s needs and interests, modify and adapt the environment, and provide tools to enhance learning (e.g., picture communication, written schedules, and sensory supports). Specific plans are also developed to provide educational and emotional support to families, and to foster teamwork among professionals. b) Developmental interventions  These include therapies that focus on building emotional relationships, fostering social communication and building social skills. Most commonly practiced are  DIR Floortime-Developmental, Individual Difference, Relationship Based and RDI-Relationship Development Intervention c) Interventions for Communication  Use of communication modalities such as sign language, communication boards, visual supports, Picture Exchange Communication System(PECS), use of social stories, and social skills training. The latter three are more commonly used strategies, with some degree of effectiveness. The Picture Exchange Communication System, or PECS, allows people with minimal or no verbal abilities to communicate using pictures. An individual using PECS is taught to approach another person and give them a picture of a desired item in exchange for that item. This thus forms a means of communication. A child or adult with autism can use PECS to communicate a request, a thought, or anything that can reasonably be displayed or symbolized on a picture card. PECS works well in the home or in the classroom. A Social Story accurately describes a context, skill, achievement, or concept according to specific defining criteria. These criteria guide the author to ensure an overall patient and supportive quality, a format,  voice , content, and learning experience that is descriptive, meaningful, and physically, socially, and emotionally safe for the child, adolescent, or adult with autism. For more advanced communication or older children, social articles may be used. The core of autism is the lack of social skills and inability to understand social nuances and graces. Social skills training provides a graded, step wise approach to train a child in the simplest of socially expected behaviour, in order to facilitate friendships in the real world, which become a challenge for a person with autism. d) Educational assistance   Structural educational approach with explicit teaching and formulation of individualized education plans is important for every child with autism. TEACHH  Treatment and education of Autistic and related Communication- handicapped Children . It involves an array of teaching or treatment principles and strategies based on the learning characteristics of individuals with ASD, including strengths in visual information processing, and difficulties with social communication, attention, and executive function. Structured TEACCHing is not a curriculum, but instead is a framework to support achievement of educational and therapeutic goals. This framework includes  1. Physical organization 2. Individualized schedules 3. Work (Activity) systems 4. Visual structure of materials in tasks and activities The goal of Structured TEACCHing is to promote meaningful engagement in activities, flexibility, independence, and self-efficacy. e) Sensory Integration  Occupational therapists use sensory integration therapy to help a child with autism play like other children. Sensory integration therapy involves placing a child in a room specifically designed to stimulate and challenge all of the senses. Sensory integration therapy is based on the assumption that the child is either over- or understimulated by the environment. Therefore, the aim of sensory integration therapy is to improve the ability of the brain to process sensory information so the child will function more adaptively in his her daily activities. f) Others   Some evidence of CBT for anxiety and anger management in the high functioning youth with ASD Animal assisted therapy, particularly use of trained dogs, has been gaining increasing popularity. The premise that a non-verbal bond with the animal, can facilitate release of oxytocin, and thereby improve social skills and bonding, as well as build empathy  forms the basis of this therapy.

In cases when the problem behavior is responsive to medication, it is with the understanding it is a symptomatic treatment, not a cure and not a substitute for appropriate behavior and education programming. Medications Commonly used in Autism include    Antipsychotics(Conventional and Atypical)   Stimulants   Antidepressants-SSRI   Alpha 2 agonists   Anticonvulsants and mood stabilisers   Anti anxiety and benzodiazepines   Sleep medication Recent Update of Pharmacotherapy in Children and Adolescents with ADD  Atypical antipsychotics, particularly risperidone and aripiprazole, are effective in reducing irritability, stereotypy and hyperactivity. Methylphenidate is effective in reducing attention- deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Atomoxetine and alpha-2 agonists appear effective in reducing ADHD symptoms. SSRI s are not effective in improving repetitive behaviors in children with ASD, and in fact, frequently cause activating adverse events. Efficacy of antiepileptic drugs is inconclusive. Newer agents, including glutamatergic agents and oxytocin, appear promising albeit with mixed results. Serious behavioral disturbance (irritability) involving severe tantrums, aggression, and self- injury is frequent in ASD. A multimodal approach is used in the management of irritability in ASD. Individuals with mild irritability may benefit from treatment with an  2 adrenergic agonist. Risperidone and aripiprazole are the only two FDA  approved atypical antipsychotics medications for irritability in children and adolescents with autism. Evidence to date has been mixed regarding the effectiveness of other pharmacologic agents for irritability in ASD. Research into the pharmacotherapy of serious behavioral disturbance is needed to develop more effective and better tolerated treatments.

Recent studies have begun to look at medications with mechanisms that are novel in the treatment of ASD like the glutamate-modulating agents. Overall, randomized, placebo-controlled studies of medications for the treatment of ASD are scarce. Psychopharmacology adverse effects Psychopharmacological agents used in the management of various issues in children with ASD are associated with a number of adverse effects. A summary of the common adverse effects can be seen in the table below  Table 9  Common Adverse effects of drugs used for ASD Class of Drug Common Side Effects Recommendation SSRI -Gastrointestinal side effects like nausea, abdominal discomfort -Emergence of suicidal ideation or behavior -Hyponatremia -Hostility and aggression -Watch for the above symptoms, especially at the beginning of treatment -Dose adjustment may be needed   start with low doses (eg. 2.5 mg of Fluoxetine as a starting dose, with a weekly increase to a maximum of 0.8 mg kg day) -Monitoring   especially if there are signs of hyponatremia -Stop medicines, if needed SDA s -Weight gain -Increased appetite -Somnolence -Sialorrhoea -EPS -Hyperglycaemia -Monitoring for the above symptoms -Dose adjustment may be needed   start with low doses -Stop medicines, if needed -Management of diet, nutrition, weight Methylphenidate  Atomoxetine -Loss of appetite -Abdominal discomfort - Headaches - Increase in irritability, -Dose management   start with low doses (eg. 0.125 mg kg day of Methylphenidate as a starting dose, small increments) -Stop treatment worsening of behavior Psycho-education for the family  It can be very challenging to break the diagnosis to parents, when their child has Autism Spectrum Disorder.",

    "text": "A few points to be kept in mind while informing them are    Autism is a neuro-developmental disability. It is lifelong. It starts in utero. It is not produced by vaccines. It is not caused by bad parenting. All children may not be similar   Early therapy helps   Education may not be the only aim   Talk to others about ASD openly   Talk to other parents of children with ASD   The path ahead may be difficult, but reach out for help at every step of the way   Furnish examples of individuals with autism spectrum disorder Table 10  Overview of Recommendations in the management of ASD Overview of Recommendations at a glance Non- Pharmacological Pharmacological Other ABA Risperidone, Aripiprazole Sensory Integration PECS SSRI s for anxiety Special education Social Stories Co-morbidity to be treated symptomatically Social Skills training Animal Assisted therapy Special Issues 1.

Maintain low stimulus environment 2. Limit number of professionals dealing with the person 3. Minimise delays  prioritise procedures 4. Liberalise diet Note  Patients with ASD may require much lower or much larger doses than commonly prescribed..thus individual titration of dose is a must. 2. Mood Disorders in ASD Fig. 4.

There is probably an experience of multiple failures in Objective assessment of mood 1. Autism Spectrum Disorders- Comorbidity for Children(ASD-CC), a 49 item rating scale to assess symptoms of emotional difficulties in children 2. Psychopathology in autism Checklist(PAC), a checklist discriminating between autism and psychosis, depression, anxiety and OCD 3. Feeding Disorders Feeding issues are common in children with ASD. These include    Poor eating schedules   Poor eating skills   Poor nutrition   Preference for specific foods   Weight gain Management Approaches 1. For Depression  SSRIs,TCA s, Stimulants 2. For Bipolar Disorder- Lithium, Divalproate 3. CBT particularly for high functioning individuals with good insight into social impairment and awkwardness. There is an overlap of phenomenology of ASD in girls suffering from Anorexia Nervosa. This is an area of further study that may help in understanding the individual and combined trajectories of these disorders. Fig 5.

These include    Insomnias (Initial, middle, terminal)   Sleep-wake cycle abnormalities Impairment in the circadian rhythms are associated with Melatonin functioning. Melatonin, as treatment for sleep issues in ASD, has been found to be effective in numerous studies. Dose requirements   1   10 mg hs   Very few mild and transient side effects may be seen   Low risk of seizure precipitation Risperidone, Clonazepam, and Clonidine may also be of benefit in sleep disorders in individuals with ASD. 5. Other issues that may be of importance  a. Personality Disorders DSM 5 has made it possible to diagnose personality disorders in adolescence. This will facilitate early recognition of and intervention for personality disorders. Personality disorders may be comorbid with ASD. However, the relation between the two is very complex. Personality disorders like Schizotypal PD have a significant overlap with the symptomatology of ASD.

    "text": "A dual morbidity severely impacts executive, social and vocational functioning. Intervention   Psychotherapies, Medication (as necessary) b. Schizophrenia Both ASD and Schizophrenia have been conceptualized as neurodevelopmental disorders, and share many phenotypical patterns. Recent studies have shown the rates of co-occurrence between ASD and Schizophrenia to be highly variable (0  - 50 to 60 ). There is an urgent need to develop specific tools to diagnose these two disorders, and further, develop intervention strategies for them. c. Gender Dysphoria and ASD Multiple studies show that individuals with ASD were significantly more likely to report experiencing gender-dysphoric symptoms than were typically developing individuals. Why could gender dysphoria be more prevalent in ASD  1. Hormonal factors Foetal testosterone ( fT) strongly contributes to sexually dimorphic cognition and behaviour 2. Elevated levels of prenatal testosterone might predispose the male foetus to homosexuality 3. Relationship between the anti-Mullerian Hormone and ASD, where lower levels of AMH have been associated with ASD symptoms in males. It is believed to play a role in the masculinisation of, or the defeminisation of the male foetus These have a huge potential for future research and diagnostic potential. d. Certification and Insurance Certification is necessary to quantify disability, avail of the benefits from the various schemes, and qualify for insurance. Disability assessment should be done using INCLEN tools  India Scale For Assessment of Autism (ISAA), following a clinical diagnosis of ASD using DSM 5 or ICD 10 or other prevalent criteria. Various other schemes availab le to autistic individuals are Niramaya (Insurance), Aspiration (Early intervention) and GyanPrabha (scholarship)   According to the Government guidelines have requested state governments to constitute certification medical boards immediately . The appropriate government shall constitute Autism Certification Medical Board comprising of a Pediatrician Pediatric neurologist, a clinical Psychologist or Rehabilitation Psychologist, and a Psychiatrist. Further, it is stated that the certificate should be valid for a period of five years for individuals below 18 years of age with temporary disability  and for those who have acquired permanent disability, should receive  permanent  validity on their certificates. e. Travel   Certification for ASD may be necessary for availing concessions by various travel authorities   buses, trains, air travel. This is important for both local and distance traveling. Considering the symptomatology of ASD like inability to tolerate change, thorough planning for picnics and excursions will be needed. It will also be helpful, if the child is repeatedly reminded of the event so that they are prepared. Specifics regarding food and clothing should also be considered. Use of pictures or a scrapbook can be very useful to prepare a child beforehand for the trip. At times, particularly for long journeys or change in altitude, one may prescribe a small dose of an anxiolytic or an anti-histaminic like promethazine. f. Planning another child Parents are often in a dilemma about whether or not to have a second child, when the first has been diagnosed on the spectrum. The tussle lies between the energy required for a child with special needs, and the hope of having a child with regular needs. Unfortunately, genetic studies and robust evidence is lacking in the area. Studies done estimate the risk to be between 3-10 , and more recently, upto 20  for a second child  when the first has received a diagnosis of ASD. The broadening of the spectrum, could be an additional contributory factor to these elevated figures. Nevertheless, infant screening and genetic counseling are advisable, for such families. g. Care after parents Caring for a child with ASD can be an extremely difficult and challenging task for parents. A permanent worry faced them is the fate of their child as she grows up to be an adult, and their future care after their passing away. Newer concepts that have come up to address such difficult issues are    Lifespan-Carers   individuals who are well versed with ASD in its totality, and the manner in which it affects the individual at all levels of functioning. They can provide help at various crucial points to individuals with ASD, throughout their lifespan. Positive Behavior Support (PBS)   It is based on the principles of Applied Behavior Analysis, Inclusion Movement, and Personalized Values. Multidisciplinary teams consisting of professionals, family members, friends, neighbors, social workers, and volunteers can ensure care and support to an individual at all times. Strong support from parents groups like Forum for Autism, Action for Autism etc. These also help deal with caregiver distress and burn out by forming a support network for the parents themselves as well.",

    "text": "Recently built centres for assisted living for autistic individuals in Gurgaon, Hyderabad and Bengaluru to name a few, have given some hope to worried parents as to what after them. Continued efforts are needed in a multicultural society like India to provide long term care for individuals suffering from ASD. Non evidence based treatments As stated by the FDA, there is no  cure  for autism, and any treatment claiming to be cura tive can be treated as a lie. Autism is a lifelong disorder which responds to intervention over a period of time, but does not disappear. It is thus recommended that one should educate parents about the following  1. Be suspicious of products that claim to treat a wide range of diseases 2. Not accept personal testimonials as a substitute for scientific evidence 3. Few diseases or conditions can be treated quickly, so be suspicious of any therapy claimed as a  quick fix  4. So called  miracle cures  which claim scientific breakthroughs or contain secret ingredients, are usually a hoax A list the therapies which have poor evidence, often can be exorbitant, to some extent even prohibitive in cost and thus not recommended are  A. Stem cell therapy B. Hyperbaric oxygen therapies C. Detoxicating Clay baths D. Products such as essential oils E. Snake oil F. Dietary plans   Gluten free  Casein free diet and the addition deletion of specific nutrients G. Lupron Therapy  Testosterone therapy H  Chelating therapies I. Secretin Injection J. Major Vitamin supplements K. Marijuana Therapy L. Bleach therapy M. TMS N. Dolphin assisted therapy O. Holding therapy P. Prism glasses etc. Sometimes in the absence of facilities for recommended therapies, parents of autistic children(who by themselves form a vulnerable population), may resort to any  many of the above. It is important thus for a psychiatrist to be aware of that what is not recommended or has a poor evidence base. It is important to also mention here, that the Centre for Disease Control, USA has clearly stated that vaccines play no role in causing autism. Parents at times, under the influence of non- scientific hearsay, do not follow the vaccination schedule, as a preventive measure for autism. The converse is actually true and lack of routine vaccination can be more detrimental to the child. Autism, despite being a challenge for most clinicians, and a lifelong condition, has found tremendous potential for research as well as intervention in the last decade. What is definitely evidenced is that earlier the diagnosis and earlier the intervention, better is the overall outcome and quality of life for not only the autistic individual, but the entire family.

    "text": "November 15, 2020   Volume 102, Number 10 www.aafp.org afp American Family Physician 629Practice Guidelines Autism Spectrum Disorder  Updated Guidelines from the American Academy of Pediatrics Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a neuro - developmental disorder affecting one in 59 chil - dren in the United States and other industrialized nations. In addition to behavior issues, ASD is associated with seizures, gastrointestinal con - cerns, sleep difficulties, and mental health issues that can profoundly impact the quality of life of children and their families. The American Acad - emy of Pediatrics (AAP) has published updated guidelines for diagnosis and treatment of ASD. Screening and Diagnosis Although the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (USPSTF) found insufficient evidence for screening, the AAP recommends a combination of developmental surveillance and standard - ized autism screening tests at 18 and 24 months of age based on better outcomes with earlier intervention. Early symptoms that may be iden - tified via surveillance include not responding to name by 12 months of age, not pointing to items of interest by 14 months of age, avoiding eye con - tact, repetitive movements, unusual reactions to sensations, and echolalia. The AAP recommends the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT ) for initial screening in children up to 30 months of age. Children with persistent defi - cits on M-CHAT Revised with Follow-Up have a 47  risk of ASD and a 95  risk of any develop - mental disorder. No screening tools are valid for children older than 30 months. According to criteria from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders , 5th ed., ASD is diagnosed by the presence of three social communication issues and two of four restrictive or repetitive behaviors (https    www.aafp.org  afp 2016 1215 p972.html  afp20161215p972-t1 ). Nearly one-third of children with ASD have intellectual disability or minimal verbal ability. After ASD is diagnosed, severity of deficits should be characterized by a multidisciplinary team  all evaluations require formal cognitive and language assessments. Occupational therapy, physical therapy, audiology, and visual assess - ments also should be included. Children with developmental delays benefit from referral to early intervention school services. One in 10 children with ASD will no longer meet diagnostic criteria by adulthood. Patients who lose their ASD diagnosis in young adulthood tend to have higher verbal and intellectual capac - ity in early childhood and earlier intervention. Testing for Causes of ASD Chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing are recommended for all children with ASD to predict prognosis. Chromosomal microarray will reveal genetic abnormalities in up to 42  of children with ASD. Fragile X testing is positive in less than 1  of patients with ASD, but it is important for genetic counseling. Targeted testing for disorders Coverage of guidelines from other organizations does not imply endorsement by AFP or the AAFP. This series is coordinated by Michael J. Arnold, MD, con - tributing editor. A collection of Practice Guidelines published in AFP is avail - able at https    www.aafp.org  afp practguide . CME This clinical content conforms to AAFP criteria for CME. See CME Quiz on page 585. Author disclosure  No relevant financial affiliations.Key Points for Practice   AAP, in contrast to the USPSTF, recommends screening for ASD at 18 and 24 months of age. Chromosomal microarray and fragile X testing can pro - vide prognostic and genetic counseling information to parents of children with ASD. Applied behavior analysis is an intensive behavior therapy for ASD that can improve outcomes, especially at younger ages. Wandering and suicide are major safety threats in children and adolescents with ASD. From the AFP Editors Downloaded from the American Family Physician website at www.aafp.org afp.

    "text": "Children with motor delays should have creatine kinase and thyroid-stimulating hormone testing. Although children with ASD have increased risk of seizures, findings on screening electroencephalography are often abnormal in children without seizures. Electro - encephalography is used only to evaluate neuro - logic abnormalities and suspected seizures. Interventions Early intervention usually includes applied behavior analysis, which focuses on learning and reinforcing acceptable behaviors while extinguishing problematic behaviors. Applied behavior analysis improves cognitive skills and behavior but is an intensive process that typically requires many hours per week of patient partic - ipation. Early intervention that includes applied behavior analysis improves cognitive function - ing and language skills, with better results from more intense therapy. Nearly all children with ASD require school- based assistance through an individualized edu - cation program, which often includes educational interventions, speech therapy, and occupational therapy. Up to 30  of children with ASD never acquire verbal speech  some will use augmented and alternative communication that includes a picture exchange communication system or speech-generating devices. About two-thirds of preschool children with ASD require occupational therapy for motor, strength, and adaptive skills. Other treatments proposed for ASD, including antifungal agents, immunotherapy, or hyperbaric oxygen, do not have evidence of benefit. There is caution against using chelation therapy because of ineffectiveness and a risk of harm. Discussing treatments with little or negative evidence often requires shared decision-making with parents or caregivers. Associated Psychiatric Conditions Most children with ASD have mood or attention disorders. Cognitive behavior therapy is effec - tive for anxiety in school-aged children with ASD, although medications are often necessary. Depression and suicide occur more often in patients with ASD, making screening important. Suicide risk is elevated in racial minorities and males and those with peer victimization, behav - ior problems, lower socioeconomic status, and lower education level. New-onset aggression or self-injury should trigger a medical examination, review of home safety, and potentially emergency stabilization with medication. Antidepressants have incon - sistent results in children with ASD and do not effectively treat aggression. Risperidone (Risp - erdal) and aripiprazole (Abilify) are approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for irri - tation or aggression in ASD, but they can cause extrapyramidal symptoms (e.g., tardive dyskine - sia) and excessive weight gain. Disrupted sleep is common and can exacer - bate behavior issues and limit the effectiveness of behavior therapies. Parent education and behav - ior interventions can be effective, and melatonin improves sleep in ASD. Other therapies are unproven. Wandering is a dangerous behavior common in ASD. Nearly one-half of children younger than 10 years have wandered from home, leading to police calls, drownings, and accidents. Strict supervision with boundaries, including locks, is often required. Associated Medical Conditions Seizures affect one in 16 children with ASD, and risk increases with intellectual disability. In 20  of patients, the first seizure occurs in adulthood. Gastrointestinal symptoms are common in children with ASD and often manifest as poor behavior or sleep disruption. Acute abdominal pain may suggest bowel obstruction or perfo - ration. Selective eating is common and can be dangerous if associated with pica. Food refusal often requires assistance from a dietitian and the applied behavior analysis professional. Blood iron and lead levels should be monitored in those with persistent pica. Poor dentition is a common source of pain, and children with ASD have fewer dental visits. Den - tists who use behavioral strategies can prevent the need for sedation with dental treatments. Transition to Adulthood Guardianship should be discussed as the patient approaches adulthood.

Young adults with ASD may qualify for selective security income for care of people with developmental disabilities. Editor s Note  This updated AAP guideline continues to recommend universal screening for ASD at the 18- and 24-month visits in contrast to the USPSTF findings of insufficient evidence to recommend for or against screening. The American Academy of Family Physicians contin - ues to endorse the USPSTF recommendation. A recent intervention that achieved 91  screen - ing in a medical system with 26,000 children showed the limitations and advantages of ASD screening (https    pediatrics.aappublications.org  content 144 4 e20183963 ).",

    "text": "Guiding Principles National Guideline for the assessment and diagnosis of autism in Australia This document is about Guiding Principles . This tells us what is important to think about when assessing and diagnosing autism in Australia. There are 11 things to think about. Client and family-centred Each client and their family should be valued as individuals and their reasons for getting assessed respected. Strengths focused Assessment should look at what individuals are good at, what they care about, and what they are interested in. Holistic Assessment should look at how all the parts of a person s life fit together, what they want and need now, and what they may want and need in the future. 2Evidence-based What happens in an assessment should be based on what we know works from research and practice, as well as what people want and find helpful. Helpful Assessment should answer the questions people have and help them get support if they need it. Culturally sensitive Each person s culture should be respected, and affect how the assessment is done and how the findings are shared. 3Respect First Nations Peoples Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples are the first peoples of Australia, and have lived in Australia for tens of thousands of years. Assessments should be safe, respectful, and helpful to First Nations Peoples. For this to happen, we need to understand the bad things that people have done to First Nations Peoples. We must show respect to First Nations culture, language, and ways of doing things like   Connection to Country  How families work together  Important stories and special places  Sorting out problems  Ceremony   a way of making somethingimportant more special. 4Neurodiversity-affirming Neurodiversity is the idea that brains work differently, and this is okay. Professionals should    Respect neurodiversity   Respect that each person is unique   Not talk about trying to  cure  autism. Competent Professionals should have up to date knowledge and skills to help them assess and diagnose autism. Equity Everyone should be able to get an assessment, regardless of who they are, where they live, or how much money they have. Coordinated Everyone should work together to make the assessment as easy, helpful, and affordable as possible for each client and their family. 5Our values Independence Integrity through autonomyInclusion Valuing lived experience Innovation Solutions for long term challenges Cooperation Capturing opportunities togetherEvidence Truth in practice Independent national source of evidence for best practice autismcrc.com.au",

    "text": "What to Say  Answers for Teens With Autism Have you ever wanted to talk to someone, but didn t know how  Knowing what to say is easy for some people. But if you have autism, it may take a little practice. Talking with others is one way to make friends and keep the friends you already have. But talking is more than knowing what to say. People also give clues about how they re feeling   like smiling when they re happy or crying when they re sad. Here s advice on how to get along with people. How Do I Introduce Myself  Introductions don t have to be a big deal. Say hello and share your name. If you re meeting an adult, you could also say,  Hi, nice to meet you. The key is to smile, look people in the eye, and be interested in what they have to say. When you do these things, it helps others know that you re friendly and interested in talking. Here are some more ways to start a conversation  Say,  Hi, what s up   to someone in the hall or when you enter a classroom. Act friendly, smile, and say,  Hi, mind if I join you   in the cafeteria or library or just say,  Hello. Offer to share something like an extra pencil, or give a compliment like,  Your backpack is nice  or  I like your shoes   Invite someone to join you by saying,  Do you want to sit here   in the cafeteria or library, or asking  Do you want to join   during a group activity. If it helps, practice what you might say with a parent or other adult you trust. This way, you ll know what to say the next time you want to talk with someone. How Do I Keep the Conversation Going  Everyone likes to talk about their favorite things. So when you re with someone, ask questions like   What do you do for fun   or  What s your favorite show   Asking questions shows that you re interested in your friend. Now keep the conversation going. When the person answers you and says something like,  I enjoy walking my dog,  comment on what they say. You could say,  I have a dog too,  or  What s your dog s name   You might even nod your head and repeat back what the other person said   Oh, your dog s name is Spot. This lets the other person know that you ve been listening and understand what was said. Taking turns talking back-and-forth is what makes a conversation. When Should I Talk About Something Else or Say Goodbye  When you re speaking with someone, it s important to know when to talk about something different or say goodbye. People are ready to talk about something else or end the conversation when they  no longer make eye contact with you look past you or around the room check their phone or do something else change the subject don t answer you back Sometimes a person will make it easy for you and say,  I have to go. Bye. If you need to leave, you can say,  I have to go,   It s been nice talking,  or  It was nice to meet you,  if you just met. What If I m Texting or Talking Online  If you re texting with a friend or talking online, it s a little harder to tell when someone wants to end the conversation. You can stop texting or typing if the person doesn t respond after the last two things you sent. What Else Should I Know About Talking With Someone  When you re talking, it s important to know what to do and what not to do. To make others feel comfortable  Talk about different things. Don t spend too much time talking about one thing or the other person might get bored. Some things you can talk about are animals, sports, food, movies, or video games. Choose things to talk about that you both like. For example, it can be boring listening to someone talk about how airplanes are made if you re not interested in airplanes. Let the other person speak. Make sure you give the other person a chance to talk. Don t get too close. Give the person you re talking with plenty of space. Stand the length of one arm (or more) away. Be friendly. Be sure to show you re listening to the other person by smiling, nodding your head, looking at them, or asking follow-up questions. Medically reviewed by  Catherine R.
